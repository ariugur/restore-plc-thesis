ABSTRACT  

THE INFLUENCE OF EMERGING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES ON SECTORAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE INFORMATION AND RECORDS MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY: A CASE STUDY OF RESTORE PLC.

Uğur ARI  

Founded in the United Kingdom in 2004 with the aim of growth in archival services, Restore plc has achieved a significant transformation in its industry by turning economic downturns and financial crises into opportunities, integrating innovative technologies into its services, and developing a pioneering business model. By expanding its service range to include not only archival services but also records management, digitization, technological installations, and corporate relocation, it has created a system that supports environmental and social sustainability within the information and records management sector. Thus, it has aligned traditional records management services with the necessities imposed by digital transformation. This study examines how Restore plc has established its own ecosystem within free market conditions.

As a group of companies, Restore plc offers a wide range of services to its clients, extending from records management and digitization processes to the reuse of IT equipment and reduction of environmental impacts. Restore Digital, a subsidiary, provides digital transformation services with the aim to enhance clients' operational efficiency, while another subsidiary, Restore Technology, focuses on services centered around reuse and secure destruction, targeting a sustainable environment. The primary aim of this research is to uncover the reasons behind its rapid recovery and strong organic growth following its establishment with modest capital and how it overcame the global financial crisis originating from the USA in 2008, achieving substantial revenues and significant gains for its shareholders through acquiring new companies and diversifying its services. To answer these questions, a literature review was first conducted, followed by quantitative and qualitative analysis of the company's corporate information sources. For this analysis, the organization's annual reports, financial statements, policy documents articulated under the visions and missions of its CEOs, employment figures, and statistical data from LSE-AIM, IMF, World Bank, and the UK National Statistics Office were utilized.

The success of the ecosystem created by Restore plc is reflected in its financial statements and employment numbers, having increased its operational revenues by diversifying income sources and raising cash flow while providing stable returns for its shareholders. These created values have led to new investments and company acquisitions. As its service spectrum expanded, it enabled the company to serve nearly all LSE-FTSE 100 index companies and strategic public institutions like the BBC, thereby further broadening its customer portfolio compared to the pre-ecosystem transformation stage. The research concludes that the company's rapid growth is attributed to its internally devised business model, dependent on its established ecosystem. It is believed that this developed business model has competitively advanced Restore plc over other firms providing services in the same industry.

Keywords: Information and Records Management, Archival Services, Digitization, Technological Transformation, Business Model, Service Ecosystem, Information and Records Management Firms.

**Founded in the United Kingdom in 2004 with the objective of advancing archival services, Restore plc. has successfully leveraged economic downturns and financial crises as opportunities to integrate innovative technologies into its operations. Through this approach, the company has implemented a transformative business model, establishing itself as a key player in its sector. Beyond archival services, Restore plc. has expanded its scope to include records management, digitization, technological installations, and corporate relocation services, thereby fostering an ecosystem that promotes environmental and social sustainability within the information and document management sector. Consequently, the company has adapted traditional document management services to meet the demands of digital transformation. This study explores how Restore plc. has developed its ecosystem within the framework of a free-market economy.**

Restore plc., as a group of companies, offers services ranging from records management and digitization to IT hardware reuse and environmental impact mitigation. Restore Digital, one of its subsidiaries, focuses on enhancing operational efficiency for clients by delivering digital transformation solutions, while another subsidiary, Restore Technology, prioritizes environmental sustainability through services centered on reuse and secure disposal. This research primarily aims to elucidate the factors behind Restore plc.'s robust, organic growth despite its modest initial capital and the 2008 global financial crisis. The company has not only recovered rapidly but also expanded through strategic acquisitions and service diversification, generating substantial revenues and delivering significant returns to its shareholders.

**Keywords:** Information and Records Management, Archival Services, Digitalization, Technology, Business Model.

**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**

In this master's thesis, the reasons behind the rapid growth of Restore plc. within the sector, driven by its business model centered on digital transformation, innovative services, and sustainability, have been investigated. The study examines the extent to which traditional document management services have been integrated into digitalization processes and the impact of the ecosystem created by the firm on financial and operational success. The distinctiveness of Restore plc.'s developed business model, which differentiates it from other companies, and its effects on sectoral competition have been analyzed. The thesis incorporates a literature review, alongside an evaluation of the company's financial statements, annual reports, and sectoral statistics, which are supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses.

The success of Restore plc.'s business model in document management and digitalization processes can be attributed to its provision of innovative solutions that go beyond traditional practices. While conventional methods have long provided a framework for managing physical documents, the rapid change and technological advancements brought by the digital age have necessitated a reevaluation of these approaches. Specifically, the digital ecosystem established by the company has not only enhanced operational efficiency but also provided significant advantages in areas such as sustainability and expanding the customer portfolio. The digitalization processes have enabled the company to achieve a distinct competitive edge over its industry rivals and have allowed the development of new methods to advance its intellectual and environmental responsibilities in document management and disposal services. Understanding the reasons behind this success story and setting a model for similar companies make Restore plc. worthy of examination.

## INTRODUCTION

With the proliferation of personal computers from the early 1980s, the widespread use of digital technologies by the masses marked a historic turning point where not only individual users, but also public services and the private sector, began embracing digital transformation. The advancement of information technologies, enabling real-time network access and allowing both natural and legal entities to provide services over the internet while executing administrative operations with electronic documents, has directly influenced the field of information and document management. Since the 2000s, as e-government applications have been implemented, it is observed that companies capable of meeting the digital service demands of institutions have emerged, and some of these companies have evolved their services alongside their technologies.

**Some software companies, in addressing the electronic document management needs of organizations, have targeted corporate information and document management services as their target market. Meanwhile, international firms like Iron Mountain, whose history dates back to the early second half of the 20th century, have expanded their product and service range through acquiring existing companies. One such company is Restore plc. Established in 2004 in the United Kingdom to provide document management and archival services, this British company has adeptly harnessed the paradigm shift with its strategy and business model aimed at proliferating digital services, making it one of the leading enterprises in the industry. Having successfully navigated its founding, the global financial crisis, and periods of renewed growth and development, Restore plc. has flourished as one of the guiding firms of the sector, providing services to over 80% of the leading companies listed on the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 (FTSE) of the London Stock Exchange. This thesis examines how Restore plc. has leveraged the advantages of digitalization to achieve success and simultaneously drive sectoral transformation. There are numerous companies in the sector providing information and document management services like the aforementioned company. However, from its establishment until 2024, with the ecosystem it formed within its corporate culture and business model, Restore distinguishes itself from other firms. In its existence story, notably in its financial statements, employment figures, and returns to shareholders over the years, it features many successes. Hence, Restore plc. has been chosen as a case study. The study analyzes the strategy and business model that the firm has applied to achieve success, and the results of this model are explained with values reflecting on statistical data.

The research began by questioning "how the demands of the free market shape a company's services; how the company influences its sector by using information technologies in a highly competitive environment to succeed." The aim of the research is to uncover "which business strategy was developed to achieve rapid growth in its sector through technological transformation." To achieve this aim in the thesis, the descriptive and documentary analysis method was used. Along with books, articles, and texts from congresses, conferences, and declarations obtained through a literature review, mostly published works, financial analysis reports, the firm's annual activity reports, and various statistical data constituted the primary reference sources.

Restore Plc. is listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). It must transparently publish its financial statements in accordance with the listing rules established by The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the regulator and overseer of United Kingdom capital markets. In terms of these rules and investor relations, the firm is obligated to publish its current financial statements on its official website. As these tables contain primary data about Restore plc., they provide significant contributions to the findings of the research. Additionally, a literature review was conducted to carry out a more detailed analysis of all financial statements published since the firm's foundation. For this purpose, detailed data not present on the firm's site, covering previous years, were accessed using the Orbis database from Sabancı University Information Center (SÜBM) and the Thomson Reuters Datastream & Eikon databases. The firm not only provides its financial tables but also offers information about its vision, mission, strategy, and business model on its website by publishing semi-annual and annual activity reports and investor presentations in written, audio, and visual formats. Various sources present in the literature were accessed to analyze this information, activity reports, and investor presentations. The Proquest Digital Dissertations & Thesis database from Istanbul University Central Library (İÜMK) was used to access theses abroad, while the Council of Higher Education National Thesis Center database was utilized for those within the country. While Elsevier E-books, JSTOR, EBSCO Open Dissertation, Web of Science, Scopus, and Statista.com databases were consulted for various sources at İÜMK, Britannica Academic, Proquest Ebook Central, and Taylor & Francis databases were searched from SÜBM. Besides these, Google Scholar, Scite.ai, Dimension.ai, Archive.org, and Scispace.ai databases were also examined.

While conducting the research, keywords in Turkish sources included “information and document management,” “strategy,” “business model,” “economics of scope,” “digitalization,” “sectoral transformation,” “merger and acquisition” whereas foreign language sources used keywords such as “records management,” “strategy,” “business model,” “economics of scope,” “digitalization,” “merger and acquisition,” “financial statements analysis,” “annual reports,” and “presentation for investors.” The Istanbul University Institute of Social Sciences Thesis Writing Guide was followed for thesis writing, and publications of the Turkish Language Association (TDK) were used for Turkish writing rules.

The thesis comprises four sections. The first section comprehensively addresses the establishment process, organizational structure, management strategies, and business model of Restore Plc. The phases the company has undergone since its establishment as Dyno Group in 2004, the changes in management structure, strategic acquisitions, and operational transformations have been analyzed in detail. The second section extensively examines Restore Plc.'s information and document management services, digitalization strategies, and their impacts on the sector. The third section addresses the company's business strategies, customer-centered approaches, and its innovative role in the sector. The fourth section is dedicated to analyzing Restore plc.'s financial performance and the impacts of the ecosystem it generates on the firm's profitability.

This study aims to elaborate on the effects of digitalization in the information and document management sector through the example of Restore plc. and to explain the sectoral dimensions of this transformation. The firm's developed business model not only reveals how it has transformed information and document management services with digital technologies but also illustrates how it has led a paradigm shift in the sector with its policies of financial sustainability. The firm's strategic acquisitions, innovations in its business model, and customer-centric approaches demonstrate that digitalization is not simply a technological innovation but a tool for economic and social restructuring. In this context, it is thought that the services provided by Restore Plc. could model other firms in the sector and interdisciplinary studies.

In 2010, it renamed itself Restore plc. According to information from Moody’s Analytics, an affiliate of the reputable credit rating agency Moody’s, none of the company shareholders owns over 25% of the shares, and thus no one possesses the real beneficial right requiring a 50.01% share ratio.

It is understood that the group has created an ecosystem within the sector using the information technologies and digital capabilities developed by itself and through its stakeholder firms and the services they produce. The company's subsidiaries, affiliated firms, and joint ventures are managed by the board of directors and an executive committee. According to the information published on their website, Restore plc.'s current board of directors and executive committee is hierarchically listed in Table 1.1 and Table 1.2.

**Table Error! No text of specified style in document. 1.1: Restore plc. Board of Directors.**

As per Article 76 of the Company's Articles of Association published in 2019, the group can appoint new board members or fill existing vacancies with new members by a simple majority decision taken at the general assembly. These appointments are conditional on not exceeding the maximum number specified for the number of board members set out in the articles. Moreover, as per Article 78, the board of directors may appoint new members to fill existing vacancies or add to the board. These members serve until the next general assembly meeting and can be re-appointed. Article 79 states there is no requirement for these members to hold shares in the company.

According to Article 114, the board can choose a chairman or vice-chairman to preside over meetings and has the authority to dismiss the chairman. The group can remove board members before their term expires by a simple majority decision. This action is announced to the public through a special notice as required by Section 312 of the Companies Act 1985 to 2006. The board can assign one or more of its members to executive roles such as general manager or joint general manager. The duties and responsibilities, salary, and other terms for these members are determined by the board. The board has the authority to dismiss a member assigned to an executive position; however, this does not affect any rights claims arising from a breach of contract.

The Board of Directors can delegate some of its powers to an executive committee. These powers can always be changed and revoked. The members of the Executive Committee include the responsible managers of the companies within the group's structure, the group's chief legal counsel, who also serves as the group's general secretary, and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The Executive Committee is responsible to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) previously appointed by the Board of Directors.

Certainly, here is the translated text tailored for a graduate thesis:

---

Additionally, the Board of Directors has established various committees including the auditing committee, risk committee, remuneration committee, nomination committee, and the environmental, social, and governance committee. The respective Board of Directors and the Executive Committee manage the primary company, subsidiaries, associates, and joint ventures listed in Table 1.3 (see Appendix 1) in the appendix section of the thesis.

Although the Executive Committee comprises five responsible directors as well as the company secretary and the CFO, approximately fifty-six companies and partnerships function under all these management titles. These sub-companies, having direct and indirect organic links with the group, operate primarily as independent firms, with seven subsidiaries, one joint venture, and one parent company (see Appendix 1).

As can be deduced from the table in Appendix 1, Restore plc. strives to meet its customers' needs and demands through an ecosystem by offering a wide spectrum of services—from conventional document management to information technology services, from road and air transportation to recycling services—with its 86 active facilities and a workforce of 2,700. Although the company’s strategy and business model are established by the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee, it is understood from the official website of the company that each subsidiary, associate, or joint venture possesses an internal operation managed by responsible directors.

1.1.3. Corporate Culture

Restore plc. is a UK-based company providing digital information and document management services alongside secure lifecycle services. The company operates five businesses organized into two divisions. The first division is Digital and Information Management. The second is Secure Lifecycle Services. Digital and Information Management comprises Restore Records Management and Restore Digital. Restore Records Management offers physical document management and archiving services. In contrast, Restore Digital encompasses workflow processes such as document scanning, workflow automation, cloud-based document management systems, robotic process automation, and artificial intelligence applications.

The Secure Lifecycle Services Division consists of Restore Technology, which offers IT lifecycle services; Restore Datashred, managing national shredding and destruction operations; and Restore Harrow Green, providing corporate commercial relocation and installation services. The company expresses its vision on the website as "providing organizations with best-in-class services in data, information, and asset management," and explains how it achieves this vision under three main headings: security, sustainability, and customer service. The company guarantees on its website that it ensures safety, compliance, and data security at all business stages in the eyes of the regulatory body (authorized government agency) for the firms they serve.

In terms of sustainability, the same text states they are market leaders by consistently providing the best possible service. Lastly, it is explained that the company’s customer service relies on their employees, who make the company a corporate business and a professional workplace, ensuring that customers entrust their assets to them with confidence.

1.2. Core Values

On the corporate official website, where the company's culture, business strategy, and transparency policies towards shareholders are explained, Restore plc.'s core values are articulated through themes such as reliability, innovation, and service excellence. These values reflect the company's commitment to fostering a customer-centric culture while providing secure and sustainable lifecycle solutions to its customers. It is possible to define the organization’s core values as customer-centricity, corporate reliability, service integrity, transparency, sustainability, and operational excellence.

Customer-Centricity: Within the organizational culture, the initial prominent core value is "customer-centricity." This value is partly based on the ability to foresee customer expectations amid evolving technological and market conditions. The value of customer-centricity is reflected in the company’s business model, which emphasizes collaboration and teamwork with customers, alignment of operational models with customers’ business processes, promotion of collaboration across departments, provision of seamless IT relocations and setups, and integration of document management and secure disposal services into the customer’s organizational structure. The realization of Restore’s operational business model is largely contingent upon offering services that bring a collaborative approach among connected digital solutions and document management according to customer expectations. By integrating these service solutions, the company enables customers to benefit from streamlined processes, thereby achieving the aim of meeting customer expectations.

Service Excellence: The core aim of Restore plc.’s activities is to deliver the highest quality service to its customers. At the heart of this customer-first approach is the idea of building long-term relationships through multi-year contracts, which secure income by associating with organizations from various sectors, including public institutions. This approach by the group is carried out through secure document storage, shredding, and digital management services that aim to protect and enhance the availability of their customers’ valuable data, as specified in the Annual Results Report for 2023. While providing all these services, the firm prioritizes integrating and ensuring the safety among different products and services, aligning it with the value of service excellence. The company also emphasizes the importance of efficiency in delivering high-quality services, highlighting service excellence in its website, promotional brochures, and annual reports.

Corporate Reliability: In Restore’s data and document management services, integrity and confidentiality are paramount. For instance, the company pledges adherence to national and international regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) operational in the UK, ensuring secure management of customer data within its lifecycle. Ethical norms in business practices and the group's dedication to the reliability it has committed to are perceived as fundamental values observable across all service domains, from document storage to the recycling of sensitive IT assets.

Integrity in Service: The firm’s value of integrity aims to maintain strong ethical standards and trust in interactions with customers, employees, and stakeholders. This value underscores its commitment to maintaining confidentiality, reliability, and high compliance standards across all service areas for its clients and shareholders.

Sustainability: Another critical value focused on by the company is sustainability concerning environmental and social responsibility. Restore endeavors to reduce its carbon footprint through energy-efficient operations, encouraging recycling services such as IT hardware recycling and secure document shredding. Its commitment to sustainability is demonstrated through services like Datashred and IT Recycling, which focus on reducing electronic and paper waste. By promoting recycling services and green IT solutions, the company strives towards zero landfill targets. Their dedication to minimizing the environmental impact of operations is considered evidence of their value placed on sustainability. Regarding innovation and ongoing improvement, they endeavor to leverage technology and continuous improvement to yield better outcomes for their clients. Continuous improvement in services is evident in their adoption of digital transformation and the integration of advanced customer relationship management (CRM) systems to enhance business performance. Adopting the latest technologies in CRM systems, automating customer data processes, and facilitating seamless data integration via systems like Maximizer CRM are all endeavors pursued to enhance efficiency and provide valuable insights to help customers manage their data assets better. Their focus on process improvements allows them to remain competitive while addressing the evolving needs of their clients.

These values help shape Restore’s operational and business model, enabling it to provide end-to-end services encompassing document management, digital transformation, secure IT recycling, and office relocations. The company's strong adherence to these values is considered a critical success factor in its growth and status as one of the leading entities in the document management sector. This approach enables the company to continuously create value for both its clients and stakeholders. Whether it is customer-centricity, service excellence, or sustainability, Restore is seen to have embraced a holistic and responsible approach to business management to preserve all these core values. Maintaining these core values is perceived to transform the firm into a reliable partner for businesses searching for secure, compliant, and environmentally conscious solutions.

1.2.1. Vision and Mission

The group articulates its vision, centered on sustainability and environmental responsibility, to lead in the document management and secure recycling sector. Aligning with this announced vision, it showcases its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategies. Restore aims to integrate ESG factors into its activities, intending to minimize the environmental impacts, such as carbon footprints, of the businesses it serves, while supporting them in securely managing their data. It is also observed to focus on fostering a circular economy by recycling IT assets and managing the lifecycle from the creation to disposal of data securely. The firm’s board is tasked with ensuring that accountability and oversight on climate-related risks and opportunities align with the group’s vision. The firm refers to the establishment of colleague-focused working groups in its 2023 Annual Activity Report as an expression of a cultural vision in carrying out all these activities. Ultimately, in determining its vision and mission strategy, customers, suppliers, and competitors are key components. The same activity report notes that in forming its strategy, the desire to guide all these target groups toward a secure business future underpins its vision of being a market game-changer.

In delineating its vision and mission, Restore plc. underscores its commitment to offering secure, sustainable, and efficient data management solutions for businesses. The company's mission is formulated around enabling the organizations it serves to manage, protect, and utilize their valuable data, information, and all assets throughout their business life cycles. Under this mission, the firm intends to provide a comprehensive service package, focusing on maximizing the value and security of its client’s business data through document management, digital transformation, and secure disposal. Additionally, aiming to generate employment by utilizing local labor where its facilities are located, the company contributes technological materials, transportation services, and financial aid to charities working for the community’s benefit, particularly child welfare organizations. Sponsorship of radio programs organized for child charities emerges among its social responsibility projects regarded as part of its mission. All the beneficial services for social good that have been undertaken as a mission have been published in annual activity reports since 2015.

1.2.2. Business Strategy

The company's strategy focuses on growing its leadership position in the UK market. Restore plc. has pursued multiple strategic acquisitions by integrating complementary businesses into its portfolio to consolidate market share, as noted earlier.

---

The company, in line with its goal to improve the margin between the production costs of products or services and their sale price, focuses its efforts on operational efficiency and enhanced customer service. Providing customer-oriented and secure services, while working on recycling, producing and using on-site and green energy, and reducing the carbon footprint, form another critical factor in the company's business strategy, termed as "sustainability." An emphasis on ESG standards represents a strategic objective for the company, aligning with broader market trends in sustainability and legal compliance. Additionally, instead of new acquisitions, the company aims to focus on cash flow for a period and pursue larger-scale expansion after solidifying its market position.

To ensure coordination among its group operations, the company adopted a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that includes all its subsidiaries since 2012. The CRM systems provider, Avrion, features its work with Restore plc. as a case study on its website. Additionally, the company releases promotional videos showcasing the work done at Restore plc. on social media channels such as YouTube. It is a widely accepted fact that selling a product or service to a new customer is five times more costly than selling to an existing customer. The cross-selling technique, aimed at increasing both the company's revenue and the income derived from a particular customer by persuading a customer to purchase additional products or services to the one they have already bought or are convinced to buy, is generally more preferred by companies. Therefore, the company officials managing the entire ecosystem with CRM using this sales technique express that they utilize the cross-selling technique more effectively compared to other sales methods in their business model, which aims to sell supplementary products and services alongside core offerings.

1.2.3. Operational Strategy

Restore plc.'s operational strategy can be described as offering a comprehensive package of document management and secure lifecycle services. The company is divided into five core business units. These are "document management," "digital solutions," "data destruction," "information technology solutions," and "corporate relocation and installation." This diversified structure enables Restore to offer services addressing the entire lifecycle of business data and IT assets, from storage and digitization to destruction and transportation.

Document Management: As one of Britain's leading document management companies, Restore supports businesses in the secure storage, management, and retrieval of critical documents under the Records Management brand. This service includes online access systems incorporating both physical and digital storage.

Digital Services: Through the Digital brand, the company provides services in digital transformation by converting physical documents into electronic formats and integrating them with cloud-based systems for secure and compliant data processing.

Data Destruction: As one of the leading secure destruction service providers in the UK, in partnership with Datashred, the firm offers both on-site and off-site document destruction solutions to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.

Information Technology Solutions: Under the Technology brand, Restore offers IT asset management, recycling, and resale services. It ensures the secure and compliant destruction or reuse of outdated IT hardware, optimizing clients' technological assets.

Corporate Relocation and Installation: Specializing in business and office relocations, this division offers end-to-end corporate relocation and installation services, including logistics, workspace optimization, and storage solutions, through its Harrow Green subsidiary.

Restore's operational strategy secures steady recurring revenue thanks to long-term contracts with clients in sectors requiring high levels of compliance and security. By leveraging the high switching costs associated with the establishment and operation of document management systems, the company pursues a strategy of maintaining long-term relationships with its clients.

1.3. Development Stages

Throughout its journey from its founding to its claimed position as a leader in its industry today, the company has experienced different phases influenced by market conditions and growth strategies. These phases can be defined as starting with modest service concepts in office management in 2004 with its "establishment and development," to the "global crisis period" during the global financial crisis of 2008, entering an "expansion phase" as it sought to create a new ecosystem by changing its business model and operational strategy, to the "ascension period" characterized by a new understanding of selling services following the ecosystem it developed. The structuring of these phases has been informed by the company’s operational revenues, employment figures, national and global financial data, alongside the relations of the company’s revenue, profit, and investment rates.

1.3.1. Structuring and Development 

The story of Restore plc. begins with the founding of Restore Group Holdings Limited. The group was established on April 13, 1992, by Swift Incorporations Ltd., which provided company formation, financial management, and administrative management supports. In 1995, partners John Minton and Richard Hunt purchased the group from Swift and transformed it into a company offering services such as computer-supported archiving, storage, and business document retrieval.

A key driver for the group's current dynamism emerged in 2004 when it was acquired by Dyno Group plc., which had opened its first office aiming to conduct general trade within England and Wales in the UK, facilitated again by Swift. On June 29, 2004, Swift transferred Dyno Group plc. under the title of Finance Directorate to Michael Vincent. On September 17, 2004, the name was changed from Dyno Group plc. to Mavinwood plc. On November 11, 2004, the company increased its founding capital from £50,000 to £10,000,000.

While the narrative of Restore plc. began in 1992, its growth trajectory, as also depicted in the graph, actually coincides with the favorable macroeconomic conditions of the 2000s when economic balances began to stabilize after the dot-com crisis.

Figure 1.1: Inflation rates between 1999 and 2007 in some countries significant in international trade in terms of GDP.

This graph, based on IMF data, shows that the GDP of the United Kingdom, United States, France, and Germany, which carry significant weight in global trade, followed a downward trend from 1999 to 2003, entering a consolidation process from 2004 onward. The impressive growth of the People's Republic of China during this period, despite the global crisis, deserves separate consideration due to its heavy reliance on cheap labor. Although China's provision of cheap labor in goods and services production is perceived as unfair competition for Western companies, it has been possible to contend with this competition through technology-focused smart and strategic management.

One of the most attractive forces for forming technology-focused smart management within companies is professional managers who have embraced digital transformation, such as CEOs of high-level decision-making bodies. Mavinwood plc. also aspired to remain competitive and gain maneuvering ability in the market by instating an experienced professional in management. Philip Joseph Reid joined Mavinwood plc. as director, and later president, on April 13, 2005. Reid served as the executive chairman of the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC), an independent public body with objectives to acquire, retain, dispose of, and grant rights related to inventions from public research when required in the public interest. Additionally, Reid boasts 30 years of experience in funding and developing newly established companies in the financial services sector, mentioning senior vice presidency at Merrill Lynch bank and chairmanships at several AIM-listed companies. 

In 2005, an application was made to list its shares on the LSE AIM stock market. On April 20, 2005, the extraordinary meeting of Mavinwood plc. convened to inform shareholders about the listing application and to present the offer to acquire Restore Group Holdings Limited for their approval. The listing application's acceptance date being November 5, 2004, confirmed that Mavinwood plc. was established mostly for investing in or acquiring companies that provide support services. Restore Group Holdings Ltd. was identified as the first acquisition target for this purpose. Mavinwood plc.'s board concluded that Restore Group Holdings Ltd., referred to as ReStore in the same extraordinary meeting announcement, offered the services listed below, and it was deemed an enterprise suitable for the acquisition purpose in belief of its potential for increased profitability and growth, serving as a robust platform to lead Mavinwood plc. in the support services market.

Rapid and efficient access through archive box storage,

Computer media and film storage,

Same-day, next-day, or day-after secure door-to-door deliveries,

File and box barcoding to ensure retrieval of files and boxes,

Online access for viewing or requesting files and boxes,

Secure destruction services,

Storage of wills, plans, drawings, medical records, insurance certificates in secure and/or private areas,

Turnkey/consulting solutions,

Off-site storage of computer tapes and magnetic media under backup/disaster recovery procedures,

Customer reading/research rooms,

Records management programs complying with legal or regulatory requirements,

Scanning of documents onto optical disks.

It is further mentioned that in 1995, the company expanded its archival capacity from 30,000 boxes to 112,000 boxes, and by 2004, this had exceeded one million. It is stated that the company, with a strong computer network at its core, offers order-based archiving/document management and tracking systems. The announcement notes that ReStore serves a wide range of clients, including lawyers, media and advertising, accounting, architecture and real estate services, banks, pharmaceutical companies, construction companies, engineering companies, insurance companies, local governments, and food producers. It has gained recognition particularly in the legal field for archiving and retrieval services and works with over 20 law firms in the United Kingdom, with revenue from these firms representing 64% of the company's earnings. It is emphasized that ReStore’s storage fees include other services such as retrieval, indexing, boxing, and shipping, which are billed additionally based on usage. Customer contracts are typically for three years and are reviewed annually thereafter, with prices fixed for the initial term and reassessed each year according to inflation rates. The same document continues with a market assessment of the current sector. One notable point in this assessment is that various factors, such as major corporate scandals like money laundering and Enron, a litigiously focused society, and extended compliance documentation retention periods imposed by regulators, have led to an increase in paperwork. According to forecasts from 2004, the idea of a "paperless office" where documents are fully scanned and stored digitally was deemed infeasible in the near future for several reasons, supported by the arguments below:

The reliability of the scanning process and storage media used is questionable and risks remain unproven;

Methods for retrieving digital data are not very reliable;

Regulations requiring documents to be retained in printed form have been reinstated;

Many British law firms have a policy of maintaining all documents in printed form;

As long as information technology solutions address corporate governance, regulatory compliance, and reducing costs with appropriate storage condition management systems, the demand for outsourced document management is expected to continue growing.

In the extraordinary general meeting announcement, Mavinwood plc. identified industry opportunities and risks and explained that this is not easy due to strong competition by listing the competing firms within the industry. The first of these is Iron Mountain, a U.S.-based firm that operates in Canada, Europe, and Latin America. The second is Recall, a subsidiary of the Anglo-Australian logistics group under Brambles Industries plc., which is publicly listed in the UK and Australia and operates in Europe and the U.S. Another is Pickfords, a subsidiary of U.S.-based Sirva Inc., operating in 40 countries including the United Kingdom. Other notable companies competing with ReStore include TNT, Crown Worldwide, House of Hill, and Graphic Data.

The company, guided by macroeconomic conditions, venture capital, and its determined objectives, has made significant strides since its founding up to the year 2007. The positive outcomes of these advancements are reflected in the operational revenues and employment figures shown in the financial statements as evidenced in the following charts. The chart illustrates operational revenues by year.

Figure 2.2: Revenues from Operational Activities of Restore plc from 2005 to 2007.

The operational revenues for the year 2005 were £15,264,000, which increased to £42,453,000 in 2006 and reached £68,153,000 in 2007. As can be seen in the graph, the company's revenue increased parallel to the growth of operations. Since operational growth is accomplished through labor, it is evident that the employment numbers increased in parallel with the revenues obtained. The graph represents the number of employees over the years.

Figure 3.3: Employment Figures of Restore plc from 2004 to 2007.

After being acquired from Swift Incorporation in 2004, the company's staff increased from two to 202 in 2005, 495 in 2006, and finally 1,052 in 2007. Together with the acquisition strategy, the increase in operational revenues and employment between 2004 and 2007 reflects the company's growth organically from its business activities.

1.3.2. The Global Financial Crisis Period

Throughout history, climate, health, wars, and economic crises have been known to affect countries as well as national or international service organizations. Such crises can lead to outcomes like concordat or bankruptcy, signaling the end for some firms, while offering opportunities for others. The financial crisis originating from the American markets in 2008 is one such example.

The financial crisis, known as the Great Recession and beginning in the U.S. financial markets at the specified date, quickly spread worldwide and deeply impacted the United Kingdom economically and in terms of employment. To prevent this financial crisis in the U.S. from turning into a global economic catastrophe, governments implemented a series of precautions. For instance, the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) and the Bank of England (BoE) took the following measures to ease the markets: implementing monetary expansion (Quantitative Easing-QE) policies, which include achieving inflation targets through monetary policies, preventing declines in employment numbers, purchasing government bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and altering policy interest rates. Despite all these measures, the bankruptcy of Landsbankinn in Iceland could not be averted. Following this bank bankruptcy, which created a domino effect, the Euro-Zone Debt Crisis emerged in 2009, as public debt levels reached significant highs in the countries known as “PIIGS” (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain) from their English initials within the Euro-Zone. Subsequently, according to the UK National Statistics Office data, the continuously growing British economy for 64 quarters (where one quarter corresponds to three months) experienced a recession by contracting for five consecutive quarters, potentially leading to economic depression. It is believed that these economic problems paved the way for the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, culminating in the referendum known as Brexit in 2016. Following this referendum, the UK decided to exit the EU by 2020, aiming to act independently of the economic and social conditions established by the Union. This could be seen as providing an advantage to local firms by creating a space exempt from EU market competition conditions and employment policies in Britain.

This financial crisis, which caused economic stagnation worldwide, also directly affected companies like Restore plc Group in Britain. The impacts on Restore plc Group are clearly illustrated in the graphs below, detailing employment and operational revenues, respectively.

Figure 4.4: Employment Figures of Restore plc from 2007 to 2012.

As seen in the graph, the number of employees fell from 1,052 in 2007 to 444 in 2008, in parallel with global developments, and to 434 the following year. From the figures, it is apparent that, for the first time since its establishment, the Group had to shrunk by reducing its personnel numbers. This can be seen as an attempt to maintain the existing structure instead of vanishing under harsh economic conditions. Experiencing a fairly stagnant period for two years, the company changed its employment policy in 2010 as market conditions matured. By increasing its staff number to 447, the company consolidated and subsequently increased its personnel numbers steadily as its operations grew.

Figure 5.5: Financial Data of Restore plc from 2007 to 2012.

The operational revenues obtained through the services provided by the Group stood at £68,153,000 in 2007, decreased sharply to £22,869,000 with the crisis the following year, as clearly seen in the graph. In 2007, the value of fixed assets—items that cannot be liquidated for cash within one year—was £83,589,000, and this figure dropped to £32,731,000 in 2008. Meanwhile, current assets were £24,629,000 in 2007, which reached £43,350,000 in 2008 before falling to £12,472,000 the following year. The total assets were £108,218,000 in 2007, £76,080,000 in 2008, and £42,960,000 in 2009. These employment and financial figures indicate that, during the crisis, Restore converted its fixed assets into liquidity to meet cash needs and preferred to shrink by reducing its personnel numbers. This situation is also reflected in the annual financial report. The company, experiencing severe negative changes in its financials and employment figures in 2008, entered a transformation process in 2009. Initially, Chairman Philip Joseph Reid stepped down and was succeeded by Sir William Wells. In his address to shareholders in the 2008 Annual Financial Report, Sir Wells defined the company's purpose as “to acquire and develop specialist support services businesses capable of organic growth or through integration with other complementary businesses having growth potential.” He emphasized a focus on the document management business, post the sale of the urgent repair division. In his letter, he noted that net operational revenue stood at £7,867,000, with operational revenue amounting to £23,156,000 in 2007 and £22,336,000 in 2008, after accounting for pre-tax loss and £6,893,000 depreciation of intangible assets. The loss from continuing operations before the amortization and impairment of intangibles, exceptional items, share-based payment credit/(expense), and notional interest on contingent consideration was recorded to be £322,000, and a basic loss per share from continuing operations was reported as £1.48 per share. The Mavinwood Group comprised two sections: Urgent Repair and Document Management. As of December 31, 2008, all Urgent Repair divisions (except Ansa Building Services Limited, 'ABS') were classified as held for sale, while the document management division and ABS were defined as continuing operations. Sir Wells detailed the impact of the crisis, stating the weakest performance in 2008 was from the Urgent Repair Division. He mentioned the sale of Mono Services Limited for £0.4 million at a loss of £1.6 million in September 2008, explaining the business was composed of social housing building repair contracts. The President reiterated that the division continued to perform poorly with low job volumes in 2009, with plans to exit the business line by December 31, 2009. Therefore, ABS was designated as an asset held for sale as of December 31, 2008.

1.3.3. Transformation Phase

Despite experiencing a stagnation caused by the aforementioned crisis, Restore plc quickly recovered, embarking on a significant economic leap. In June 2010, the company changed its official name from Mavinwood plc to Restore plc. In the 2010 Annual Activity Report, Group Chairman Sir William Wells expressed that the firm returned to profitability, noting a turnaround from a £0.1 million loss in 2009 to a £2.7 million profit in 2010. Additionally, Wells stated they doubled the firm's adjusted operating profit from £1.5 million in 2009 to £3.4 million in 2010.

In 2009, the firm's management underwent changes. Following the resignation of Philip Reid, Sir William Henry Weston Wells succeeded as Chairman, and the board was restructured. In the annual result report published in 2010, Chairman Wells outlined the growth strategy as growing through profitability, but primarily through acquisitions. The report continued to state acquisitions in line with this growth strategy, including the acquisition of Datacare Limited for £1.1 million and Formsade Limited for £0.7 million. The Strategy section of the same report mentioned that most operations were inter-business support and anticipated that large businesses would reduce suppliers and prefer larger ones, emphasizing that new acquisitions are targeted during the consolidation process in their market. In the annual report published the following year, Chairman Sir William Wells, addressing the investors, stated that four strategic acquisitions were completed, aligning with the previously stated objectives, thereby transforming Restore plc in the UK into a broader entity offering office services. Under the heading of Acquisitions in the report, significant details were provided, potentially demonstrating more concretized plans for the future. Following this, the entrepreneurial activities included the following:

Acquiring Sargents, an office relocation and document management company, from receivership for £0.5 million, they entered the corporate relocation sector;

By acquiring Management Archives, a Leeds-based document management firm, for £0.7 million, they began operating in Northern England;

By acquiring Glasgow-based Paterson Data Management for £0.6 million, they expanded their operations into Scotland;

They acquired Brunswick Document Management, based in Middlesbrough, North East England, for £1.2 million;

They acquired a 50% stake in the London-based Thoroughshred firm for £0.3 million, with an option to acquire the remaining 50% from shareholders within three years.

The same President noted that the name of the recently acquired company was changed to Restore Shred, indicating that through this move, Restore had entered the secure paper destruction and recycling sector. 

In the same report, it was expressed that with these maneuvers, the Company expanded in line with its strategic aims to serve clients throughout Britain. Considering the conditions of the acquisition of the company named Sargent, it can be considered that BOE's quantitative easing policy, which encourages investment and borrowing during economic crises, created favorable conditions for the Group to implement its strategy of becoming a supplier to major corporations. How BOE's quantitative easing policy created favorable conditions for companies can be seen more clearly in the following Dollar Index graph.

Figure 6.6: U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)

The situation created by the crisis led to a global shift towards the U.S. Dollar from financial markets worldwide, as seen in the United States Dollar Index (DXY) graph published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED), where the value of the dollar currency appreciated. The DXY index is comprised of a basket of major world currencies positioned commercially against the U.S. Dollar: 57.6% Euro (EUR), 13.6% Japanese Yen (JPY), 11.9% British Pound (GBP), 9.1% Canadian Dollar (CAD), 4.2% Swedish Krona (SEK), and 3.6% Swiss Franc (CHF). The DXY, which measures the value of the U.S. Dollar against a basket of major other currencies, is widely used to reflect the dollar's strength and measure trade orientation. As seen in the graph above, following the crisis, during the third quarter of 2008, due to the global shift of money from exchanges and other currencies seeking to move to U.S. bond yields, the basket of major currencies given above depreciated against the dollar. As a result, the currencies of other developed and developing countries, which weigh heavily in the global trade and financial system, lost value, significant losses occurred in their exchanges, adversely affecting import and export balances, and leading to recessions in national economies. The central banks, major influencers in investments and finance including the FED, ECB (European Central Bank), and BOE, applied the policy interest rates illustrated in the graph below in the process to counteract this situation, revitalize inflation, and direct investments, creating a favorable conju...

Figure 7.7: FED, ECB, BOE Policy Interest Rates 2006-2013

As seen in the graph, the FED, ECB, and BOE cooperated in QE policies by lowering policy interest rates and injecting money into the market through credit. Thanks to this, Smart Money, managed by market experts, central banks, funds, and other market professionals, was prevented from heading towards bonds, deposits, and derivative instruments because interest rates remained below inflation, producing no real gain returns. Additionally, by opening the way for banks to provide low-interest loans to businesses and households, both the money and real economy were relieved.

While Restore plc. was financially facing a crisis, the macroeconomic solutions crafted for the crisis greatly contributed to the enterprise's growth. At that time, liquidity that would not be available under normal market conditions was transferred to the real market through banks with the cooperation of major central banks to overcome the crisis. This hot money entering the market allowed firms to increase their existing business volumes at a national and global level; it also sparked new investments to open new job areas and kickstart the reentry of money into exchanges. The reflection of this into the real economy is clearly shown in the graph below.

Figure 8.8: UK GDP and PMI Data from 2007-2013

The Standard and Poor’s (S&P), a reputable rating agency, published the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), which shows the tendencies of purchasing managers in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors to purchase goods and services, and compared these period data with GDP data, a deep “V” formation was observed in the graph in parallel with the crisis and QE policy in the UK. When PMI data falls below 50 points, professionals assess this as a sectoral contraction causing a reduction in economic activity. Naturally, since PMI index results are reflected in finance as well as the real economy, it can be said that GDP results were formed this way.

Figure 9.9: UK Inflation Rates from 2007-2013

During the same period, while a sharp decline in the inflation trend was observed, it is understood from the graph published by the IMF that inflation entered a rising trend again after the QE policies, reaching a peak which could be considered the summit for the period at 4.5% in 2011. Based on the data, it is considered that the expansionary monetary policies led to an overheating of the economy, which positively correlated with rising inflation, yielding beneficial results from this policy for the UK.

In the macroeconomic context explained above, by 2012, Sir William Wells, then Group Chairman, detailed the acquisition of the remaining 50% stake in Restore Shred and other company acquisitions of four strategic significance in his address to investors in the Annual Report, providing the detailed results of the changes. In the initial move, Harrow Green, described as the leading corporate relocation company at the time and a significant part of the Group's ecosystem, was acquired with an initial price of £6.1 million, with £5.6 million debt and additional payment conditions of £1 million in 2015. Also, a London-based corporate relocation company, ROC Relocations, was added to the Group with £0.2 million from an administrator. It is stated that M&L Document Destruction, a Middlesbrough-based secure paper destruction and recycling operation, was purchased for £0.3 million, geographically expanding the operational activities of Restore Shred. In...

In the Strategy section following his letter, the Chairman states that the Group is focused on office services in the UK. He underlines that their growth strategies are based on the principles of “deepening and expanding.” He states that deepening, primarily through acquisitions, means their market position moved from eighth to second in less than three years, indicating an increase in market share in the UK. Expanding, on the other hand, he explains by giving the example of Restore Online's aim to provide additional services complementing existing operations such as online data backup business.

By 2013, in the Annual Report, it is documented that the Group purchased File & Data with an initial price of £6.1 million with a £0.15 million additional payment option; Atix for £0.9 million; and IT Efficient, a Bedfordshire-based IT asset disposal company, with an initial price of £1.9 million and a £0.4 million additional payment option. In his traditional address letter, the Chairman continues by stating that in the last four years, the company grew significantly in terms of revenue, profit, and market value, with revenue in document management increased by 150% and profitability by 250%. Claiming that they secured market leadership in corporate transportation with Harrow Green, purchased the previous year, Sir Wells also lists the services below, which he states are needed by customers, as significant developments:

A rapidly growing paper destruction and recycling business in Restore Shred;

An IT Asset Disposal business with substantial growth potential in Restore IT Efficient;

A small but continuously growing online storage business.

In the continuation of his letter, he states that they have prioritized making significant investments in the CRM systems mentioned above to ensure sales personnel, regardless of the service area, can identify and leverage other connections within the Group. Simultaneously, expressing that they always assess the opportunities to offer additional services complementing existing operations, the Chairman declares, as stated in the 2012 Annual Report, that they have clearly defined the characteristics of the areas in which they operate and aim. These characteristics include:

A constant, recurring revenue element;

A specific operational network that enables good margin provision;

Certainly! Here's the translated text:

---

An access channel compatible with the market (generally through customers' facility or IT managers);

Creating an ecosystem where it is neither desirable nor practical for customers to change suppliers;

Increasing the potential for cross-selling of other offered services.

Figure 10.10: Visual Representation of the Restore plc. Ecosystem

The image above, which was used on the cover of the Annual Report published in 2014, is designed to illustrate the ecosystem and business model created by the Group. Previously, the company, which did not use any visuals other than financial statements in its reports, introduced its new face and operating style to its investors through these and similar visuals. Parallel to this visual, the effects of change could be observed in various data in the following years.

Figure 11.11: Restore plc. Operating Revenues from 2013 to 2023

As depicted in the graphs above, the "deepening and expansion" strategy, implemented through step-by-step company acquisitions, has consistently positively reflected on the Group's operating revenues and employment figures over the years. As seen in the graphs, the company exceeded the numerical threshold of one thousand in employment in 2015, and this increase was reflected in operational revenues in 2016, surpassing the £100 million threshold. In 2018, while the employment rate surpassed the two thousand mark, there was a consolidation process between 2019 and 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19, after which employment figures rose almost to test the three thousand thresholds by 2023. It is understood from the graph that the increase in employment, the consolidation, and the subsequent resurgence have directly impacted operational revenues. While the company pushed the £200 million threshold in operational revenues in 2018, it surpassed that threshold in 2019, but in 2020, which we consider the beginning of the COVID-19 period, it fell below £200 million again. In 2021, it achieved more than £200 million, and in 2023 and 2024, it exceeded £250 million in operational revenues, indicating from the financial and employment figures that Restore plc. has become a much healthier structure compared to the previous crisis period.

1.3.4. Growth Phase

By 2019, Restore plc. organized its operations under two main divisions, document management and corporate transportation and installation; in the first division, document management and secure document destruction and recycling services, and in the second division, technology and corporate transportation and installation services were designed, preserving the two-division structure, which marked the beginning of its current structure in 2020, and expanded its ecosystem by adding digital services to the first division. However, on December 8, 2019, the first COVID-19 case was seen in Wuhan, China; on December 31, China alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) to the outbreak that would subsequently develop into a global pandemic.

Figure 12.13: Stock Markets at the Beginning of the Covid-19 Period

From January 1, 2020, the direction of capital markets changed, witnessing sharp movements in the world's most significant stock exchanges and indices, and after WHO declared the disease a pandemic on March 11, substantial proportional losses, as seen in the above graph, occurred from March 6 to 18.

Figure 13.14: West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Futures Oil Chart

On April 20, 2020, due to transportation and storage costs, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures oil barrel prices fell below $0 for the first time in history, as seen in the graph published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), demonstrating that trade worldwide had come to a standstill. This development triggered central banks to act again, similar to 2009, leading to the re-implementation of QE policies.

Figure 14.15: Central Banks' Policy Interest Rates During the Covid-19 Process

As seen in the graph, central banks of major economies, accepted as developed, like the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union, provided market access to easy money, reducing policy interest rates to as low as -0.10% (Bank of Japan - BOJ). While Russia faced extraordinary developments in its economy due to financial, commercial, military, and diplomatic sanctions because of its war with Ukraine, developing economies like Brazil and China chose both to cut interest rates and devalue their currencies to not lose competitiveness against the US Dollar.

Figure 15.16: Covid-19 Period and After PMI Data

As observed in the graph, PMI fell to 27.1% in new export orders in April 2020, while manufacturing declined to 39.6%. All these data indicate that global trade had come to a halt. In such an environment, despite conducting business-to-business (B2B) operations, Restore plc., with previous crisis experience, faced an 18.01% loss, with operational revenues falling from £215,600,000 to £182,700,000 at the year-end compared to the previous fiscal year. In the financial crisis of 2008, as mentioned above, while operational revenues were £68,153,000 in 2007, they declined to £22,869,000 in 2008, with a loss ratio of 198%. However, when comparing the two crisis periods' free cash flow, the difference is more pronounced when we look at the cash flow remaining after subtracting expenses from the cash flow via operations, investments, and finance into the firm.

Figure 17.18: Cash Flows of Restore plc. from 2019 to 2023

The data from two different crisis periods in the graph above show that the enterprise's foundation phase has become notably different and financially more resilient to crises. In the first graph, as seen, operating revenues, free cash flows, and capital expenditures (CAPEX), which represent investments in tangible fixed assets including initial investment costs, capital costs, and expenditures for construction, equipment, machinery, installation, etc., have experienced significant fluctuations along with the crisis. During the pandemic crisis, operational revenues peaked at £517,000,000 in 2020, observing a flat trend in the subsequent three years. There is a downturn in capital expenditures compared to the years 2006-2010, while still maintaining a flat trend. In the Annual Business Report published at the end of 2023, Group Chairman Jamie Hopkins, in his address to investors, stated that they are now focused on improving operational performance, increasing margins, and maintaining a high level of cash production, declaring that they do not plan any strategic acquisitions. Over the 2019-2023 period, it is evident that free cash flow, which has been particularly observed by capital market investors, has grown and stabilized. This situation, as claimed on Restore plc.'s website and in the reports published in recent years, points to a market leadership position.

RESTORE PLC. SERVICES

2.1. An Overview of the Services

Restore plc. supports its users with an ecosystem encompassing a wide spectrum of services. The primary line of business can be defined as information and document management, which includes data, information, and asset management. However, its business strategy and model demonstrate developments that differ from traditional information and document management practices.

Table Error! Reference source not found..3: Services provided by Restore plc.

As shown in the table above, the company organizes its services under two sections. The first section, digital and information management, is divided into two business organizations, while the secure lifecycle services in the second section are separated into three business organizations.

2.2. Information and Document Management

2.2.1. Document Management

The company regards document management services, which provide 45% of its revenue, as the core line of business within its ecosystem. It serves 6000 clients from all sectors, ranging from the public sector to insurance companies. Given its business volume and the revenue it generates, document management services appear to be the driving force of the Group.

According to data obtained from the financial statements on the organization's corporate website, the Records Management company within the firm generated revenue of £124.1 million for Restore plc. in 2023 through its document management services. The company created a business volume of 22 million boxes [archive materials] with the firms it businesses with during these services. As per information from the same source, the document management services have facilitated the employment of 885 workers. The Records Management company offers services such as document storage and management, on-demand document digitization, LTO tape and media storage, preservation of legacies and similar valuable collections intended for future generations, crypt storage for documents and archive materials requiring long-term storage, project management, and consultancy services.

These services are executed in 52 facilities owned by the Group as its proprietary resources. In performing these services, the firm maintains the sustainability of service quality and business by adhering to internationally recognized standards and certifications such as Cyber Essentials Plus, ISO 9001, 14001, 27001, 22301, BS 10008, and PCI-DSS. Holding and keeping these certifications up to date can be perceived as crucial to sustain service quality.

While conducting physical document organization as part of its document management and archiving services, the Records Management company works in close collaboration with Restore Digital, a Group subsidiary providing digitization services, for partial or complete digital transfer of documents arranged according to clients’ needs.

In operating document management and archiving services, the Group aligns energy use with its ESG targets, applying solutions like solar panels and energy contracts supported by the REGO (Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin) certificates compliant with EU standards to generate energy at the source. This indicates the Group’s investment in both environmental and sustainability policies.

2.2.2. Digitization

On its corporate website, the Group characterizes digitization as the next step and complement to document management services. Digitization operations, known as converting a wide range of analog materials, primarily paper, into electronic format, are conducted for both current and archived materials. More specifically, this service ranges from digitizing daily documents produced in client company offices to one-time digitization of administrative documents and patient records in a hospital archive. Restore Digital, which manages the Group's processes related to digital services, provides document digitization services together with digital mail and other communication tools storage, bespoke workflow automation, natural language processing and artificial intelligence services, electronic document management systems, and digital transformation consultancy, based on client demands.

According to information retrieved from the organization's corporate website, this business line achieved a revenue of £46 million in 2023 while hosting 769 million documents on cloud technology and providing employment for 694 individuals. The company carries out these services in its own eight facilities, ensuring sustainability in service quality in digitization services, as it does in document management, by acquiring certifications such as ISO 9001, 27001, 14001, 45001, 22301, BS10008, Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus, PCI-DSS, and DCB 0129.

2.3. Secure Lifecycle of Corporate Information Resources

The company’s secure lifecycle services are divided into three business lines: information technology equipment, secure information and document destruction, and corporate transportation and technology installation, as seen in the table above.

2.3.1. Information Technology Equipment

The Group conducts its information technology equipment services through its company, Restore Technology. The primary business domain of the company is to supply IT equipment and establish infrastructure. The company identifies corporate firms and public institutions as its target audience, with its main business being the disposal of all IT assets that have become obsolete and out-of-date, including computers, hard drives, recording devices, phones, pagers, switches, security systems, and kiosk-like identification systems. Additionally, the company revitalizes technology by selling or donating discarded yet still usable equipment and devices from corporate companies and public institutions to the second-hand market or charities.

According to their annual activity report, the transformation and development of their services in information technology equipment are realized with IT Efficient, a company acquired and incorporated into the Group in 2013. The report specifically notes that the company conducts activities related to the disposal of IT assets for client companies with this firm. By declaring that the Group has increased its effectiveness in disposal and other electrical device destruction services based on information technology after acquiring IT Efficient, it announced its market leadership in 2023.

## Restore Technology as a Subsidiary

In 2023, Restore Technology, as a subsidiary, processed the disposal and destruction of 1.9 million assets ranging from desktop computers to portable drives, large data storage systems to servers, and from pagers to mobile phones, generating a revenue of 31.1 million pounds. Additionally, it states that this operation created employment for 360 individuals. This activity, as well as its document management and digitization services, were conducted across its six facilities. As in other business domains, the company operated under similar standard certifications previously mentioned.

### 2.3.2. Secure Information and Document Destruction

In 2016, the group redefined the services of a company it acquired, PHS Data Solutions Limited, to focus on secure data destruction. In that same year, the subsidiary's name was changed to Data Solutions 2016 Limited. By 2019, the company slightly expanded its service area and rebranded itself again as Restore Datashred Limited, providing secure data destruction services based on traditional and new generation technologies.

The firm, which also conducts traditional document destruction and paper recycling activities, sells scrap paper to recycling centers in the United Kingdom and other global paper factories to recycle approximately 50,000 tons of paper annually. Additionally, the company offers destruction services for sample products, defective goods, counterfeit CDs, DVDs, fake items, work clothing, imitation garments, bags, and accessories. The company explains on its website that to offer better services to its clients, it has diversified its secure destruction services and reinterpreted them as "on-site destruction," "off-site destruction," "single-use destruction," "destruction in bulk," "destruction in home-office settings," and "secure serial destruction within 48 hours."

Company representatives proclaim that certain destruction operations are concurrently performed at the same facilities as document management services, underscoring that data destruction is a crucial part of the Restore plc. service ecosystem. As per the 2023 annual activity report, a revenue of 35.9 million pounds was generated along with employment for 304 individuals across 11 facilities under this service segment within the same year. Restore Datashred, which operates the secure destruction business of Restore plc., is also accredited with Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus, ISO 9001, 14001, 27001, 45001, NPSA, and PCI-DSS certifications.

### 2.3.3. Corporate Relocation and Technology Installation

According to the group's corporate website, Harrow Green, a subsidiary conducting corporate relocation and technology installation services, is claimed to be a leader in the UK. The firm, whose presence in the market dates back to earlier years, was established in 1983 under the name Harrow Green Removals. As a company conducting commercial relocations, it transports all movable assets of organizations established by public institutions or private enterprises, changing its name to Harrow Green Limited in 2004.

Acquired by Restore plc. in 2012, Harrow Green broadened its service area, giving a new dimension to relocation. Besides transportation, it has expanded its service domain by also undertaking the setup of furniture, physical archives, and IT equipment delivered to new locations, introducing a fresh service approach in relocation. According to annual activity reports published by the company, it transfers movable cultural assets such as physical national heritage and museum properties, ranging from an antique painting to a handwritten rare manuscript, a precious stained glass piece, to finds within the country to different cities, and to Europe and various regions of the world, providing consultancy services to clients upon request. It offers services including strategic planning, contract management, relocation planning, contractor management, data collection and integration, information management, filing and storage consultancy, project communication consultancy, workspace support and supervision, help desk services, cost/change control, and inspection, project management services, including layout planning, interior fittings, furniture sales and rental, furniture refurbishment, asset audit, storage solutions, as well as offering multiparty contract and leasing options for furnishing and interior arrangement services.

In 2023, by employing 397 individuals, it executed the transport and reinstallation of 413,000 fully equipped personnel desks and generated a revenue of 40 million pounds. The subsidiary, owning 9 facilities, is accredited with Cyber Essentials Plus, ISO 9001, 14001, 27001, 45001, and BS 8522 BAR certifications.

## CHAPTER THREE: IMPACT OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION ON RESTORE PLC.’S BUSINESS MODEL

### 3.1. The Company’s Digital Transformation Process

The integration of software and hardware capabilities and opportunities of digital technology into Restore plc.'s business model can be seen as an essential part of its strategic transformation. Over the years since its inception, the company has evolved into a more digitally-focused enterprise distinct from a traditional document storage service, mainly through acquisitions and internal transformation. It’s observed that this transformation began with the acquisition of File and Data Storage, IT Efficient, and Atix in 2013 and Cintas Document Management in 2014 to meet the existing demand for digital solutions. The company, established in the United Kingdom in 1991 to offer document and data storage services, acquired a robust digital customer portfolio alongside accumulated expertise with the purchase of Cintas Document Management, which was one of the island's leading document scanning and archiving companies. It offered services such as hard copy archiving, document scanning, confidential document shredding and destruction, pallet and self-storage, online backup, security, and collection/delivery services, along with document management services.

The incorporation of these four tech-focused service-producing and selling firms has undeniably contributed to Restore plc.'s digital transformation prowess. By 2016, the company acquired its greatest competitor in the digital solutions market, PHS Data Solutions. This acquisition is perceived as a strategic move for Restore plc., as PHS Data Solutions was an institution implementing the advanced digitization jobs that the company was aiming for, allowing Restore to provide digital document storage and data destruction services, thus increasing its market share. Additionally, just before the acquisition in 2016, PHS Data Solutions received approval from the competent authorities to provide cloud services to the public sector, which enabled Restore to offer cloud services to public organizations as well.

Initially founded under the commercial title of Preview Services Limited in 2002, and later renamed as Cintas Document Management UK Limited, the firm was acquired in 2014, and its commercial title was changed first to Restore 2 Limited and then to Restore Scan Limited in the following year. After the acquisition of PHS Data Solutions, all digital-related organizations were consolidated under the commercial title of Restore Digital Limited in 2019.

Buying IT Efficient laid the groundwork for investments in the technology field and the establishment of Restore Technology Limited in January 2019 for Restore plc. Prior to this, the company had acquired ITP Group Holdings Limited, offering services in toner and ink recycling, in 2015. However, with the declaration from the then-CEO, Charles Skinner, stating, "We want to focus on the IT hardware lifecycle sector," ITP Group was sold again in 2019.

By divesting companies it owned but deemed irrelevant to its strategic objectives while acquiring companies considered competitors to utilize their business potential and subsequently dissolve them, Restore plc. can be seen as making significant moves to establish the ecosystem it plans to create in its digital transformation journey. A prime instance can be seen in the case of ITAD Works. Acquired in 2017 and dissolved in 2021, ITAD Works supplied, exchanged, repaired, and provided recycling services in the IT hardware lifecycle for public and private institutions in the UK and Europe. Here, a dual objective seems to have been pursued. Firstly, by incorporating companies having potential competition with itself, it strengthens its services in that area while preemptively halting potential competitors. Secondly, in its pursuit of accommodating itself and its services to digital transformation, it endeavors to be more powerful and influential in the market by drawing on the strength, customer base, and business experience of the firms it acquired to encompass under its Restore Technology brand. After acquiring and dissolving ITAD Works in 2017, the Group acquired Euro Recycling in October 2020, a company providing secure disposal of IT assets, stating its objective to enhance the secure destruction capacity of the subsidiary named Restore Technology in and out of the field. Following Euro Recycling, in 2021, it acquired firms such as Computer Disposals Limited, which is a secure computer disposal company, The Bookyard, possessing the capacity for secure disposal of Apple products, and PRM Green, an entity having the capability for environmentally responsible secure disposal of electronic devices. Lastly, in 2022, it incorporated Ultratec, which conducts disk erasure and recovery operations, into its operations. Following all these acquisitions, the respective companies were unified under the subsidiary that was transformed from IT Efficient to Restore Technology Limited as a result of a title change in 2019.

Annual reports reflect changes in the Group's traditional business model following the relevant acquisitions. In the "Annual Report And Accounts 2010," published in 2010, it was stated that Restore's main business and a substantial portion of its revenue stemmed from document recovery and storage. Progressing towards 2016, as company acquisitions increased, the reports gradually highlighted corporate relocation, followed by technology installation, destruction, and various auxiliary services. By 2022, although the Records Management subsidiary, which managed print-based information and document management activities, appeared to hold the largest share with 41% of revenue, what stood prominent in the annual report and in the interview given by Charles Bligh, the CEO of the time, to the English news channel Sky News, was the aim of the Group to grow by creating an ecosystem with its digital and technology services. The subsequent year's report articulates the Group maintaining these same objectives, stating the inclusion of increasing cyber and artificial intelligence risks into their plans for 2024. On the website of Restore Digital, it is indicated that they contribute to clients' collaborations with generative AIs through the digitization of their data.

On another note, the new opportunities reached particularly in the software dimension of digital technology are causing Restore plc. to revisit its digital transformation strategy and set new targets. New software applications emerging from machine learning to blockchain and especially the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence hold critical interest not only for global firms like Microsoft and Apple but also for Restore plc. While organizations rely on their intrinsic resources in setting long-term strategies concerning the services they offer, many statistical firms provide new data simultaneously. For example, according to a study published on Statista.com—a statistical database widely accepted and utilized, particularly among academic bodies—the AI market is projected to reach 20.68 billion pounds by 2030.

Figure 18.1 UK Artificial Intelligence Market Share Projection

Certainly, here's the translated text in fluent, formal English suitable for a graduate thesis:

---

As observed in the graph above, despite experiencing fluctuations between 2021 and 2022, it is anticipated that investments in the field of artificial intelligence will increase in the coming years. One reason for this fluctuation could be the intense competition in the sector, where some rivals, unable to keep up with certain developments, halt their investments and engage in re-planning. Indeed, it is considered that Apple's venture to reach an agreement with OpenAI, despite ceasing its own AI production, stems from its inability to influence developments as desired. These developments can be interpreted as signaling an increase in investments in artificial intelligence through consortia, as forecasted in the graph.

Another factor highlighting artificial intelligence is the emergence of services that meet market expectations through AI-driven robots. Current trials are predicted to expand their market shares in both the service and industrial sectors by the same date, namely 2030. The graph below provides a visual representation of this idea.

Figure 19.2: Market Share Forecast for AI-Based Robotics in the United Kingdom

As Restore plc. provides intercorporate services, it is evident that changes within the industry will have direct impacts on its services in various dimensions. AI in service and industrial robotics not only alters the workflow of company services but also has the potential to generate new data, which might create new job sectors in the future, though unknown today.

Another explanation presented in the same database shares that the market for generative AI, defined as next-generation artificial intelligence, in the United Kingdom is expected to reach £13,642,840,000 by the year 2030.

Figure 20.3: Market Share Forecast for Generative AI in the United Kingdom

Generative AI is accepted as a more advanced technology compared to current AI, which is expected to increase competition through new investments. Since this will cause changes in the industry, it is considered reasonable for Restore to shape its future plans and investments accordingly.

In the 2022 annual activity report, the Group claimed that the companies Restore Digital and Restore Technology ranked first in their respective areas within the UK market. The same report stated the value of the digital market to be between £330 and £335 million, and the technology market was valued at £580 million.

As seen, digital and technological innovations have altered the strategy and business model of Restore plc. over time. This ecosystem created through such change has enabled the Group's organic growth. Following digital transformation, both scientific and financial developments in the AI sector are expected to provide new opportunities for Restore plc.

3.2. Business Model of Restore Plc.

3.2.1. From Business Model to Business Continuity

Restore provides a range of core services related to document and data lifecycle management, including document management, digital solutions, secure destruction, technology asset management, corporate relocation, and technology installation services. These services cover various stages, from physical storage to secure destruction and digital transformation, involving data management, security, and sustainability.

The company operates all these services through its business model developed in light of its corporate culture and service policy. One of the fundamental pillars guiding this business model is ensuring continuity in the services offered. This aspect rests on the continuity of service quality and advantageous cost basis for the customer. Here, cost has two dimensions: first, the continuity of the service enables customers to gain benefits from Restore such as discounts, advantageous campaigns, and different service modes tailored to the customer. Secondly, because abandoning the services provided by Restore could create new costs and uncertainties for clients, renewing the service contract becomes more advantageous in terms of the service to be procured. These two cost factors explained aim to ensure continuity in service sales while generating recurring revenue streams for Restore.

Considering the company's growth trajectory since its founding, it is evident that it developed this business model through the ecosystem it established. The foundations of this ecosystem can be said to have been laid in 2013 when IT Efficient was incorporated, and services began to be offered with a technology focus. This ecosystem enabled the company to develop a specific business model. Restore’s philosophy of ecosystem development and the services it provides based on this approach have long corresponded with the widely accepted "lifecycle of documents" concept pertinent to managing corporate knowledge resources. The company undertakes all necessary tasks from producing to managing, organizing, to disposing and destroying information and documents that constitute corporate memory during the continuity of the functions aimed at achieving the founding objectives of the customer companies it serves.

As seen, by developing an ecosystem providing service supply for numerous tasks present in a company’s life from its establishment to dissolution, Restore appears to have ensured business continuity linked to this ecosystem and its developed business model.

3.2.2. Critical Success Factor in the Business Model

The business continuity within the ecosystem created by the Group provides confidence to existing shareholders as well as hope for new investors. Particularly, the ongoing revenue stream established through its devised business model attracts more investors to its shares traded on the London Stock Exchange. Here, long-term contracts in the fields of document management and secure document storage are seen to play an effective role in ensuring continuous revenue flow.

When companies entrust their sensitive information to a provider offering storage, protection, and security services, they typically understand that opting to switch to another provider for the same services later would entail high switching costs. Such costs are not merely financial expenditures but also encompass labor costs related to learning the new company’s operations, time costs associated with adapting to new business partners, or even psychological costs arising from former service commitments. Consequently, the services provided by Restore are considered critical for its clients due to these reasons.

Customers receiving different services such as document storage, management, access, utilization, disposal, archiving applications, and technology installation, pay Restore regular monthly or annual fees according to the contract structure. For the Group and its shareholders, this means stable and predictable cash flow. Cash flow refers to the available liquid assets rather than future receivables and is derived from operating, investment, and financing activities. The cash flow data in a company's financial statements showcase its financial resources and assist in evaluating its liquidity. According to Timothy Jury, a financial consultant, CEO, and author, during a crisis, fixed assets may be sold, inventories reduced, creditors increased, and overheads decreased. However, such processes have a natural limit; a point is reached where an enterprise cannot continue trading without the remaining assets and overheads. When a business is in distress, capital providers and creditors are unlikely to be interested in supporting it further. If the business cannot generate cash flow to manage operations, cover expenses, and debts, bankruptcy becomes inevitable. By structuring its business model within its developed ecosystem, Restore plc. demonstrates a reliable company profile through the liquidity flow it ensures, akin to Jury's perspective. Therefore, as it creates renewed cash flows, document management and archival services are considered the backbone of Restore plc.'s business model.

3.3. Marketing Techniques in the Business Model

---

3.3.1. Cross-Selling

In a free market economy, businesses have developed various sales techniques to increase sales and profit margins for their marketed products. Alongside face-to-face sales (brick & mortar), wholesaling, and business-to-business (B2B) sales, another method is cross-selling. In the field of marketing, cross-selling is considered one of the most effective sales techniques aimed at enhancing a company’s revenue by selling additional or complementary products to a product already purchased by the customer.

Many national and international companies like Hepsiburada, Migros, Alibaba, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and Amazon utilize the cross-selling technique in their sales. According to the CEO of the esteemed American strategy and management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, which deals with numerous multinational and international companies and groups, cross-selling can increase sales by 20% and profits by around 30%. It is believed that the measurable contribution of this technique to a business allows for better management of the sales process. This contribution is quantified using a formula cited in Dwight S. Ritter’s book "Cross Selling Financial Services," which indicates the ratio of firms utilizing this technique.

The total of the initial sales, as mentioned in the formula, refers to sales without the inclusion of cross-selling. Meanwhile, the total of the second sales shows the turnover obtained from the products sold using the cross-selling technique. For instance, consider a scenario where customers purchase one hundred packets of pasta from an online store. Suppose it is observed that the first forty customers buy only the pasta, while the next sixty also purchase the recommended yogurt along with the pasta. Here, the first forty customers represent the total of initial sales in the formula, and the second group of sixty customers represent the total of second sales. By dividing the aggregate of these two groups' sales by the total of initial sales, we obtain the ratio of cross-selling’s contribution to overall sales.

We observe different examples of the described cross-selling technique at Restore plc. The critical success factor in successfully implementing this sales technique lies not only in the ecosystem it has created but also in its growth strategy of acquiring and integrating similar businesses. As previously mentioned, Restore plc. has pursued an acquisition strategy to expand its market share and diversify its service offerings. This strategy includes acquiring smaller competitors or companies providing complementary services. Thus, Restore does not need to implement a bundled model where different services are packaged and sold at a discount, but instead, it can offer tailor-made service packages catering to specific customer needs. A customer can benefit from an integrated solution for all data and document lifecycle needs, opting to work with Restore for document management, digital solutions, and secure destruction. Hence, Restore offers its customers complementary or related products across its departments through one of the most effective methods of marketing, cross-selling. The success achieved by the company verifies the sales technique methodology discussed by Liu, C. and Cai, S. in their research and publications on cross-selling techniques.

The company operates in highly regulated sectors such as law, healthcare, and financial services, where strict compliance with data privacy and storage regulations is crucial. By designing its services to meet these legal requirements, Restore prevents its clients from incurring legal and financial penalties due to non-compliance. It cumulatively ensures the organic connection, integrity, and correlation between services to prevent incongruities among services procured from different firms. This business model bases its service marketing on making “compliance” a core part of its value proposition. This compliance not only provides the service-buying client with a single point of contact across different lines of business, but also ensures clarity regarding where to resolve issues and errors that may arise, with a clearly defined accountability to the state during audits. Any break from this system results in higher costs for a client.

As can be seen, Restore plc.'s business model is built on long-term and renewable contracts, acquisitions, and the services operated across five divisions. It caters to both physical and digital data management needs while focusing on regulatory compliance, sustainability, and technological innovations. Even though customized service packaging is in question, its operational activities are service-oriented, with recurring revenue streams and growth driven by acquisitions being key components.

Companies using advanced customer relationship management (CRM) systems, like Restore plc., aim to maximize customer satisfaction while protecting the company's interests through cross-selling techniques. Consequently, the firm assures its shareholders of organic growth through a healthy financial ratio structure achieved with the sustainable cash flow reached by this cross-selling technique.

3.3.2. Suggestive (Upselling)

Suggestive (upselling) sales, or as it is otherwise known, upselling, is a marketing technique where the seller proposes to the customer more of the product they are purchasing or a product that may be suitable but is more expensive. The distinction between suggestive selling and cross-selling lies in the former’s aim to increase order volume by selling more products or services than initially purchased, while the latter attempts to sell a more expensive version of a similar service. Sellers widely use this technique to clear excess inventory and accelerate cash flow.

The ratio of products sold by utilizing this method can be explained with the following example: Of any one hundred unit products, forty products are sold using this technique. This sale represents the following straightforward percentage finding formula.

In its Strategy and Business Model presentation, Restore plc. states its focus on generating more cash flow using the suggestive selling method, thereby matching its acquisition strategy to expand its service network to satisfy both its investors and customers. The group conveys that this technique, used in marketing its operational field services, is also applied to create work environments for clients wishing to work remotely or from home, aiming to provide them with more comfortable spaces. In Restore’s ecosystem, the diversity of businesses and subsidiaries enables it to engage in cross-selling across a broad client base, while the suggestive selling method offers the opportunity to provide special packages to meet further needs of customers seeking a single service.

Restore’s financial transparency policy emphasizes in its 2023 annual report highlights its financial strength, infrastructure adequacy, knowledge, experience, expertise, and business potential, marking the “barrier to entry” in the field as substantial. Overcoming this barrier is not easy, often taking considerable time as it involves fierce competition. It is noted that such operations require appropriate facilities and an expansive client portfolio to build trust with clients, which develops over time. The report further connects Restore’s success in overcoming the entry barrier to the creation of its ecosystem and the sale techniques linked to its business model, facilitating long-term client relationships. An example of establishing long-term relationships is provided by the subsidiary Records Management, where the “storage service contract” for the preservation, protection, and security of archived materials has an average duration of fifteen years. Similarly, another subsidiary, Restore Datashred, has an average client contract duration of seven years. The requirement to renew contracts every three or five years due to the seven or fifteen-year cycles ensures business continuity for the group. Such business potential indicates the firm’s operational continuity to its shareholders and provides assurance regarding continuous cash flow from contractual commitments. Moreover, increasing legal regulations by the state within the sector necessitates varied certifications and documentation for new entrants. Restore's long-standing presence in the industry gives it an edge over rivals due to its required certifications and qualification documents. The examples pointed out above illustrate how Restore’s ecosystem and acquisition strategy over the years have led to a reduction in potential competitors while maintaining revenue growth continuity through implemented cross-selling and suggestive selling methods.

Sources indicate substantial benefits for firms employing both cross-selling and suggestive selling techniques together. Researchers Robert C. Blattberg, Byung-Do Kim, and Scott A. Neslin, notable for their works in marketing and customer management analysis, in their book "Database Marketing: Analyzing and Managing Customers," assert that companies using either or both methods simultaneously can harness three potential benefits.

The formula features LTV (long-term value), expressing a customer's enduring commercial relationship with the company and representing “customer value in the long run”. Where mt represents the profit contribution at time t, r denotes the customer retention rate, and δ signifies the discount rate. Firstly, it could be stated that cross-selling/suggestive selling carries a higher sales potential within the current period. In this structure, alongside regular sales, the customer also purchases a product suitable for cross/suggestive selling. The acquisition of a new product leads to an additional fee contribution to the seller company's future current period's fixed income. This scenario, from one perspective, highlights the potential of cross/suggestive selling in obtaining additional or complementary products for the item acquired. Finally, a less noticeable aspect in the formula is the potential of cross/suggestive selling to increase the customer retention rate in the long-term.

In a simplified summary, LTV describes a metric that explains the total financial benefit derived from a customer’s long-term relationship with the company. The first part, mt, represents the profit ratio provided by the customer in every current period. Next, rt-1 indicates the customer retention rate over time t, reflecting the likelihood of the customer remaining with the company. 1-δ indicates the discount rate applied to bring future earnings to present value. Finally, t-1 is added to represent the continuity of customer loyalty and the potential change in this loyalty over time. To illustrate with an example, a customer's profit in a specific year is 1000 units initially. If there’s an 80% chance the customer will continue after the first year, that year's profit is multiplied by this rate. Using the discount rate to bring the second year's profit to present value gives its today’s equivalent. The time element is incorporated into the formula to account for how customer loyalty affects profit over the years. Ultimately, this formula allows for a realistic calculation by considering customer attrition probability (r), discount rate (δ), and the time factor effect. In other words, focusing more resources on high LTV customers can work to increase profitability. Within this context, it's considered that LTV will aid the company in better planning its customer relations and marketing strategies.

**Figure 22**

### .2: Net Working Capital Figures for Restore plc, 2004-2023

Working capital is a measure representing the difference between a company's current assets and current liabilities, and it evaluates whether its liquidity is adequate. There are two types of working capital. The first is gross working capital, which refers merely to the total current assets, and the second is net working capital, which is obtained by subtracting short-term liabilities from current assets. It is also an indicator of the company’s capacity for maintaining a healthy liquidity flow and stock management essential for daily activities. As seen in the graph, the Group's net working capital has consistently increased in a positive direction since 2011.

### 4.1.2. Sectors Created and Employment Provided

Restore plc. has enabled numerous new sectors as part of its operations within the industry through the ecosystem it has established. Examples include email room operator, data management consultant, group communication and engagement leader, and IT security manager. To recruit experts that can be termed as new generation specialists for various needs, Restore advertises job postings through its own website, https://restorecareers.co.uk/. Another method utilized is the incorporation of human resources from relevant companies under its own umbrella, thanks to the Group’s acquisition strategy. However, according to the Global Document Outsourcing Market 2024-2028 report published by Technavio, a global industry and economic market research company, there is a global challenge in finding qualified human resources due to the rapid advancement of technology, the complex structure of data-related tasks, or the necessity of being knowledgeable about legal regulations, which require skill and experience. Like other companies in the sector, it can be conjectured that Restore may face the same risk in the near future.

Restore plc. has previously mentioned in its annual activity reports that one of its socially responsible missions is to utilize local labor. This approach applies to its hiring practices along with the firms it partners with. The Group supports a human resources policy that ensures employees do not face discrimination and can express and conduct themselves regardless of their beliefs, culture, sexual orientation, etc. Furthermore, Restore plc. expects all employees to collaborate in a manner that highlights the corporate culture within a clear mission and vision, where everyone's voice is heard, communication is secure, and the environment is tolerant.

In light of this information, when examining the employment created by the company based on data from the Bureau van Dijk database, a subsidiary of Moody’s Analytics, it is evident from the graph below that the company has achieved a consistently growing employment figure from its founding in 2004 up to 2008.

#### Figure 23.3: Employment Figures for Restore plc, 2004-2023

The global financial crisis experienced between 2007-2008 was felt worldwide and, based on data obtained from the World Bank, it increased the unemployment rate as depicted in the graph below.

#### Figure 24.4: Global Unemployment Rates by Percentage, 2004-2023

The financial crisis deepened impacts on London, known as one of the world’s major financial centers. The World Bank unemployment rates indicate that, in parallel with global developments for the 2007-2008 period, there is an upward trend in unemployment rates, also evident in the United Kingdom as shown in the graph below.

#### Figure 25.4: Unemployment Rates in the United Kingdom, 2004-2023

Again, according to the graph, from 2008 to 2016, when strategic acquisitions began to intensify, the Group maintained stable employment. When these three graphs are compared, it becomes evident that from 2016 to 2023, including the period that could be termed the Covid-19 era, the Group increased its employment figures and, contrary to global trends, did not engage in mass layoffs. This positive situation may be considered evidence of the success of Restore plc.’s ecosystem created through digital and technological initiatives, as the created business volume and continuity also ensure sustainability in employment opportunities.

### 4.1.3. Revenues from Operations

As previously mentioned, from its founding in 2004 until 2007, Restore plc. implemented the business strategy determined by its founders. However, faced with the challenges arising from the global financial crisis in 2008, the management was handed over, entering a period of strategic rehabilitation until 2012, and finally attempting to create a new ecosystem from 2013 up to the present. The analysis of this ecosystem, which is the result of extensive efforts and significant investments, also depends on the analysis of revenues from ongoing operations. By evaluating the company’s operational efficiency using current quantitative data obtained from financial statements, the functionality of the created ecosystem can be better understood.

According to the financial evaluations in the Presentation of the Group’s Annual Results Report published for 2023, it is stated that they achieved a solid revenue of £227.1 million, appearing stable in comparison to 2022 overall. The adjusted operating profit margin is £44.3 million, which is 15% less compared to 2022, while pre-tax adjusted profit, again, stands at £30.3 million, down by 26% compared to the previous year. Operational profits before tax, obtained after deducting statutory obligations, are reported at £29.0 million, and the total net debt in fixed and current assets has been reduced by 6% to £97.8 million, compared to the previous year.

#### Figure 26.6: Revenue Distribution Rates According to Restore plc.'s Ecosystem

In the light of all these data, the current operational revenue distribution of Restore plc. for 2023 is shown in the graph above, taken from the published presentation. The Group derived 36% of its operational revenues from storage services predominantly characterized by document management and digitalization unit contributions. The distribution within document management and digitalization services consists of 54% from storage revenues, 23% from subscription services, and the remaining 23% from one-off provided services.

Restore plc.'s second largest sources of operational revenue are subscription and one-off services, each holding a 21% share. Of these, contributions to the secure lifecycle services unit stand at 19%, and the second is at 18%. Contributions from document management and digitalization have been outlined as stated before.

The remaining contributions from corporate transportation and product sales revenues to the Group are 12% and 10%, respectively. Corporate transportation services offer negligible contributions to document management and digitalization services but contribute the most to secure lifecycle services at 32%. Product sales services, while reflecting a similar trend to the first service unit, also provide the second most significant contribution at 25% after corporate transportation.

### 4.1.4. Cash Flow Statements

### The Phenomenon of Cash Flow versus Profit and Loss

The concepts of cash flow and profit or loss are often confused with each other in terms of content. The phenomenon of profit or loss is reflected in the balance sheet and income statement as items arising from a business's operations and from other sources such as the sale of land, buildings, and equipment, or income from interest. However, a company's cash flow has its own financial statement and illustrates the cash entering or leaving the company’s treasury regardless of the profit or loss obtained.

Generating cash is almost vital for businesses to conduct their operations and achieve their goal of earning a profit. There are thought to be two primary ways of generating this cash. The first is the injection of cash into the company's equity by investors through means such as loans or investments. The second is the ability to sell services or products for a higher amount than the production costs. Even if a service or product is sold on terms that involve different time frames, these transactions are reflected in the financial statements as accrued revenue. However, since there is no cash flow into the business’s operations during the relevant period, such commercial transactions are not seen in the cash flow statement.

Even if a business sells its related products and services on credit terms, it will still need cash to produce these goods or services, to make payments for loans, leasing, or salary expenses, etc. Therefore, cash flow statements provide business owners, investors, banks, and other financial institutions offering credit or leasing support, as well as regulatory organizations, with crucial insights into whether a company has a healthy operation.

#### Table Error! Text not found in the document style..12: Restore plc. Net Income, Net Cash from Operations, and Additions to Fixed Assets between 2004-2023

The table above presents data from the cash flow statements of Restore plc., showing the amount of cash the business started with each year until 2023, the revenue earned from its operations, and the cash spent (in GBP) for purchasing or renewing assets such as buildings, new firms, equipment, machinery, etc. The purpose of selecting these data sets is to demonstrate how much cash the company could generate starting from a net cash point by showing the net cash earned from business activities during the current year. Moreover, additions to fixed assets may provide investors with essential insights into how much the firm is investing in its business, whether it is at the beginning, development, or maturation stage of its business life cycle, and whether earnings are being used efficiently for the company.

#### Figure 27.7: Figures of Operating Revenue and Additions to Fixed Assets of Restore plc. from 2004-2023

The graph shows parallel increases in cash flow generated from operational activities following cash additions to Restore plc’s fixed assets after 2012. The primary contributor to this cash flow generation is likely considered to be the investments made by the company into the ecosystem it has formed over the years.

Businesses refer to free cash flow as the net cash remaining after opex and capex expenditures. Free cash flow signifies profitability converted into cash, not accounting for non-cash expenses such as depreciation in financial statements. Businesses can utilize their free cash flow to make new investments, refresh assets like machinery or facilities, or distribute it as dividends to shareholders.

#### Table Error! Text not found in the document style..13: Free Cash Flow Figures of Restore plc. from 2004-2023

Free Cash Flow (FCF) is not included in financial statements. There is no mandatory standard for calculation. In general, the cash remaining after opex and capex expenditures is accepted as free cash flow. To determine the net cash item from business activities, opex expenditures need to be deducted. Additions to fixed assets directly include capex.

#### Figure 28.8: Free Cash Flow Figures for Restore plc. from 2004-2023

The table above presents Restore plc.'s free cash flow figures from its establishment up until 2023. The graph demonstrates that, especially after the year 2012, Restore plc. has achieved stability in FCF generation and consistently produced cash. This circumstance is one of the important indicators showing that the company has healthy financial management.

### 4.2. Financial Status on a Global Standard

In the discipline of finance, businesses are generally analyzed using basic and technical analysis methods. Technical analysis is applied to public companies to forecast future share prices based on their share performance. On the other hand, fundamental analysis is applicable to all firms whose financial statements can be accessed, as a means to evaluate them financially and managerially. Based on fundamental analysis, the ratios analyzed apply to the data in balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements constituting a company’s financial statements. Through this, the firm’s performance is assessed in terms of profitability, efficiency, liquidity status, solvency, the performance of the firm’s managers, and growth trends over the years. Financial analysts working in banks, brokerage company analysts, individual investors, and academicians frequently employ financial ratio analysis for assessments. Financial ratio analyses are examined under categories such as profitability, operational efficiency, liquidity management, debt repayment capacity, and market effectiveness ratios. Restore plc.'s financial data at global standards can be evaluated under these headings as follows.

#### 4.2.1. Profitability Ratio Analyses

Profitability ratio analyses are conducted to determine whether the methods used by businesses, whose primary aim is to generate profit, are effective in being able to achieve this goal. For a better understanding and utilization of these ratios, they can be examined under two fundamental subheadings. These are called margin ratios, which represent the ability to convert sales figures into profit at various stages of measurement, and profit ratios, which measure overall efficiency in generating returns for shareholders.

**Margin Ratios:** Gross profit margin, operating profit margin, net profit margin, and cash flow margin fall under this category.

**Gross Profit Margin Ratio:** This metric indicates the extent to which an enterprise efficiently utilizes its resources related to materials, labor, and production to generate profit. It is calculated using the formula below.

To derive gross profit: 

***Cost...***

---

Businesses that do not generate a good gross profit margin are considered unable to cover their operational activities and other expenses. For instance, if a company incurs a cost of 10 million lira to produce its goods or services and other expenses and sells them for 20 million lira, it is earning 50 kurus as gross profit for every 1 lira gained per product or service. Consequently, the company’s gross profit margin is 50%. Restore plc.'s gross profit margin ratios over the years are illustrated in the following chart.

Figure 29.9: Gross Profit Margin Ratios of Restore plc., 2004-2023

As understood from the chart, since its establishment, Restore plc.'s gross profit margin has fluctuated between 37% and 58%. According to American entrepreneur Warren Buffet, considered one of the most successful investors in history, companies with a gross profit margin consistently at 40% and above over the years have a competitive advantage.

Operating Profit Ratio: This metric measures a company's profitability from its main activities after paying for office, sales, and other expenses.

The operating profit margin provides analysts insights into the interest and tax-exempt profit ratio for each lira earned from the products or services produced or provided by the business. Below is a graph related to the operating profit margin ratio of Restore plc.

Figure 30.10: Operating Profit Margin Ratios of Restore plc., 2004-2023

As seen in the graph, the operating profit margin ratio of Restore plc. has generally followed a stable course over the years, similar to the gross profit margin ratio, but observed a contraction of 21% during the 2008 crisis. This indicates that most of the revenues obtained during those years were not from their main activities.

Net Profit Ratio: As the name suggests, the net profit ratio is a metric showing how much net profit a company generates for each earned lira. A low net profit margin ratio serves as a warning to investors that the business is at risk profit-wise, indicating potential direct losses if there is a dip in sales. The following chart presents the net profit margin ratios of Restore plc. from its establishment to the present.

Figure 31.11: Net Profit Margin Ratios of Restore plc., 2004-2023

Except for the 2008 crisis period, Restore plc.'s net profit margin has generally maintained a stable course, consistent with the gross and operational profit margin ratios. However, the decline in the net profit margin ratio might not always be interpreted negatively. For instance, while new investments, capacity increases, etc., may reduce the net profit margin ratio in the short term, they can be compensated by future profits. Therefore, rather than focusing and making assessments based solely on one current year, evaluating it as a process might be a reasonable assessment.

Cash Flow Margin: Preferred, especially due to including actual cash transactions compared to the net profit margin, this metric is used to measure a company’s efficiency by showing the cycles in paying expenses, times taken to collect receivables, and the periods spent delaying inventory purchases to conserve cash on hand. Analysts from lending institutions particularly use it. Regardless of how much a business earns, if it does not have a stable positive cash flow, it faces the risk of being unable to meet its operations and expenses. Such businesses may resort to borrowing or increasing capital. However, the primary goal of a company should be to earn profits from its main activities; otherwise, the cash flows obtained will be temporary.

Figure 32.12: Cash Flow Margin Ratios of Restore plc., 2004-2023

As observed in the chart above, the firm’s cash flow margin ratio has remained stable except for the period during the 2008 crisis. However, businesses may experience negative cash flows in certain periods due to making new investments or building facilities. Hence, other variables included in the financial statements should also be considered and evaluated.

Return Ratios: Defined in the financial glossary on the official website of Nasdaq, the world’s second-largest stock exchange, return ratios are metrics that measure a company’s profitability in relation to various investment criteria made in the firm. These can be expressed as return on capital employed, return on equity, earnings per share ratio, and return on assets.

Return on Capital Employed (ROCE): This metric shows investors how efficiently a business uses its financial resources. By its nature, the return on capital employed is a ratio whose efficiency can only be understood in the long term, as the efficiency of long-term financing can only be determined within a specific period. In this way, the long-term performance of business management can also be measured. The formula below is applied to obtain the return on capital employed ratio:

The formula to achieve the return on capital employed ratio is as follows:

The graph below contains the return on capital employed ratios of Restore plc. from its establishment to the present.

Figure 33.13: Return on Capital Employed Ratios of Restore plc., 2004-2023

The graph above presents the return on capital employed ratios of Restore plc. from its establishment to the present. In line with the previous graphics, the Group, which exhibited poor performance after the 2008 crisis, is seen to have attained sustainable stability in the return on capital employed ratios following changes in management after 2009.

Return on Equity (ROE): This important metric for shareholders is a ratio that shows the net income obtained by the company’s equity. In this way, shareholders can calculate how much net income they are achieving from the resources they commit to the business’s equity. A high return on equity naturally indicates the efficiency of investor savings, whereas the opposite implies low efficiency. Before calculating the return on equity, it is necessary to calculate the net asset.

---

After determining net assets, the following formula is applied to reach the return on equity.

The chart below shows the return on equity ratios for Restore plc.

Figure 34.14: Return on Equity Ratios for Restore plc., 2004-2023

During the 2008 crisis, Restore plc. incurred significant losses for its shareholders but managed to recover swiftly, continuing to provide its shareholders with stable returns from equity.

Earnings per Share (EPS): Considered the most crucial variable in determining the value of a stock, the earnings per share metric is defined as the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of a common stock, a type of publicly traded stock not entitled to any special rights. Before calculation, dividends determined for preferred shares, which afford owners rights to profits, liquidation shares, pre-emption, and voting, are deducted from the earnings per share. The earnings per share is calculated according to the following formula.

The chart below presents the earnings per share of Restore plc. from its inception to the present.

Figure 35.15: Earnings per Share for Restore plc., 2004-2023

It is observed in the chart that since its inception (except during the 2008 crisis), Restore plc.'s common stock has provided stable returns to its investors on the AIM stock exchange.

Return on Assets (ROA): This metric demonstrates how efficiently a company uses its total assets to generate profit. Return on Assets indicates a company’s full capacity to produce profit, serving as an analytical value for investors. The following formula demonstrates how to calculate the return on assets ratio.

The following chart shows the return on assets ratios for Restore plc. over the years.

Figure 36.16: Return on Assets Ratios for Restore plc., 2004-2023

From its founding year to the present, and especially after 2010, the firm has shown consistent profitability within a certain range through effective utilization of its assets.

4.2.2. Operational Efficiency Analyses

Metrics that measure the efficiency of the outputs—such as sales, new customers, and new market areas—produced by an enterprise from inputs like money, raw materials, tangible and intangible assets, and labor are called operational efficiency ratios. These ratios can be divided into two main categories: efficiency multipliers and durations. Under the efficiency multipliers category, one can analyze net asset turnover multiplier, fixed asset turnover multiplier, interest coverage ratio, and inventory turnover multiplier, whereas receivables collection duration and debt payment duration fall under efficiency durations. Explaining the aforementioned ratios and analyzing Restore plc. will provide more information about the enterprise. Thus, the operational efficiency of the ecosystem that it started to form after 2009 can also be observed.

Net Assets Turnover Multiplier: This metric measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate income by comparing its revenues or sales to its assets. Companies with a high asset turnover multiplier are considered efficient, whereas the opposite situation is deemed poor performance. The asset turnover multiplier is calculated according to the formula below.

Figure 37.17: Net Asset Turnover Ratios for Restore plc., 2004-2023

The chart above illustrates the net asset turnover ratios for Restore plc. from its founding to the present for the outputs created. Excluding the crisis years, it is generally understood that all assets have been used with an average half-point multiplier.

Fixed Asset Turnover Multiplier: This metric measures the contribution of fixed asset investments to net sales by comparing the net sales listed in the income statement to the fixed assets in the balance sheet. A high fixed asset turnover multiplier not only indicates the positive contribution of fixed assets to sales but also suggests that the company's management is using its investments in fixed assets efficiently. To calculate the fixed asset turnover multiplier, it is necessary to find the average fixed assets for the current period along with the net sales. By applying the formulas obtained from the income statement and balance sheet data, the relevant multiplier can be determined.

Below are the fixed asset turnover multipliers for Restore plc. over the years.

Figure 38.18: Fixed Asset Turnover Multipliers for Restore plc., 2004-2023

### Translation of Academic Text:

It has been observed that Restore plc. has consistently utilized its fixed assets within the multiplier range of 0-4 since 2004. However, similar to other metrics, the fixed asset turnover multiplier does not convey significant meaning as a standalone data point; it should be evaluated alongside other data and compared with the industry average.

**Interest Coverage Multiplier**: This multiplier indicates how easily a company can pay the interest on its debt, showing how many times its earnings can cover the annual interest payments on its long-term debts. It is particularly significant for institutions or investors who lend either directly or through debenture bonds. A higher interest coverage multiplier is perceived as indicative of a solid safety barrier for debt repayment. To calculate the interest coverage multiplier, any type of debt included in the company's current or fixed assets is taken into account. The interest coverage multiplier is calculated using the following formula.

The graph below depicts the interest coverage multipliers for Restore plc.

**Figure 39.19**: Interest Coverage Multipliers of Restore plc. from 2004 to 2023

As shown in the graph, during the years when Restore plc. was establishing its ecosystem, the company significantly increased its interest coverage multiplier and generally maintained a tendency to stay at or above the multiplier of 2.

**Inventory Turnover Multiplier**: This metric shows how many times a company's inventory has been replaced and sold during the current period, indicating how well the company manages its stocks.

It can also be calculated using the formula below.

A higher turnover multiplier signifies faster inventory turnover and indicates that the company's primary activities are active. Additionally, if the average inventory turnover is to be analyzed in days, the following formula may be applied.

The below graph depicts the inventory turnover multiplier and daily averages for Restore plc.

**Figure 40.20**: Inventory Turnover Multipliers and Daily Averages of Restore plc. from 2004 to 2023

Despite Restore plc.'s ecosystem being predominantly service-oriented, the graph reveals that there are materials such as IT devices and recycling materials in inventory with high turnover multipliers and daily averages. Additionally, it is understood that in certain periods, inventory turnover multipliers have decreased, which is reflected in the daily average. It might be inferred that sales slowed down during these periods, or there may have been an increase in inventory due to the acquisition of new businesses. It was previously mentioned that the Group had a purchasing strategy and that the most intensive acquisitions occurred in the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. More detailed information can be obtained when the data derived from general observations are examined in the context of the relevant current period.

**Collection Period**: As the title implies, this metric refers to the timeframe in which a company collects its receivables arising from trade. It has a significant impact on cash flow and is an important indicator for investors and lenders. The shorter the average collection period, the better managed the receivables are from the company's perspective. It is calculated with the formula provided below, and the graph displays the collection periods of the Group over the years.

**Figure 41.21**: Average Collection Periods of Restore plc. from 2004 to 2023

When the Group was established, the collection period rose to an average of 91.63 days and 101.79 days during the 2008 crisis, as illustrated on the graph. Since 2014, this period has declined, achieving relatively positive stability compared to the past. This data should be considered with regard to the fact that Restore plc. operates predominantly through a subscription model.

**Credit Period**: This metric highlights the average number of days a business takes to pay off its trade debts within a given year. To calculate the credit period of a business, the formula provided below is applied, and the graph features Restore's credit periods.

**Figure 42.22**: Average Credit Periods of Restore plc. from 2004 to 2023

As observed above, the credit period of Restore plc. was slightly over two months during its founding years but decreased to approximately a month or slightly less since 2008, continuing consistently.

#### 4.2.3. Structural Ratios

Structural ratios not only show a company's financial structure and long-term debt-repayment ability but also indicate whether it can repay its debts on time, carry out its main operations appropriately, and manage its cash flows healthily. We can divide structural ratios into two subcategories to evaluate a company’s financial health and risk profile. Firstly, under liquidity and leverage ratios, we consider ratios like the current ratio, acid-test ratio, cash cycle period, and net debt to EBITDA ratio. Secondly, under financial structure and debt ratios, ratios such as asset-based repayment capacity ratio, liability-based repayment capacity ratio, total assets to equity ratio, long-term debt to total capital ratio, and borrowing ratio can be considered.

**Liquidity and Leverage Ratios**: Liquidity refers to a company's ability to quickly and cheaply convert its assets into cash. Liquidity ratios are financial metrics used to determine a company's ability to meet current debt obligations without raising external capital. The leverage ratio and finance metrics evaluate the level of debt within a company. They are used to measure how much of a company’s capital comes in the form of debt (loans) or to assess the company’s ability to fulfill financial obligations.

**Current Ratio:** The current ratio represents a company's ability to meet its short-term liabilities upon their maturity, used to assess short-term payment capabilities. It is calculated using the formula provided below.

Generally, the current ratio is expected to be between 1.5 and 2, but, like every metric, it can be misleading if evaluated in isolation and should instead be considered within context. The graph below displays Restore plc.'s current ratios.

**Figure 43.23: Restore plc. Current Ratios from 2004 to 2023**

Except for its founding year, it can be observed whether Restore plc. has undertaken any significant capital increases. As illustrated in the graph, a stable performance between the range of 0.50% and 2% is evident.

**Quick Ratio:** As a stricter liquidity measure, the quick ratio is an indicator of a company’s short-term liquidity position, evaluating its ability to meet short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets. The quick ratio's calculation formula is shown below.

The graph below depicts the annual quick ratio distributions for Restore plc.

**Figure 44.24: Restore plc. Quick Ratios from 2004 to 2023**

Similar to the previous graph, Restore plc. generally demonstrates a stable profile apart from its founding year. For this test, which is expected to average around 1, it is observed that the ratio drops to around 0.5% during crisis years for Restore plc., as shown in the preceding graph.

**Cash Conversion Cycle:** This metric calculates the length of time between spending money on production and receiving cash after the product is sold. The cash conversion cycle indicates worsening liquidity as the duration lengthens and reflects the company's ability to generate cash as it shortens. A longer cycle suggests the firm requires more financing and serves as an early warning measure. The following formulas are used for calculation, and the group's cash conversion cycle averages are depicted in the graph.

**Figure 45.25: Restore plc. Cash Conversion Cycle Averages from 2004 to 2023**

Restore plc.'s cash conversion cycle shows varying trends over the years, decreasing or increasing according to the period’s conditions. It is notably observed that these days extend during crisis periods, clearly highlighting the impact of market conditions.

**Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio:** The net debt to EBITDA ratio is utilized to demonstrate a company's financial strength by relating its net debt level to EBITDA. This metric provides essential insights into the company's financial risks by showing its net debt relative to the profits obtained from operations. A higher ratio indicates that the debt burden surpasses operating income, suggesting potential risk for the firm. Generally, a ratio between 0-2% is considered normal, indicating low debt and high profitability. A ratio between 2%-4% suggests the firm's debts are at a manageable medium level. Ratios over 4% denote cash flow challenges and a prolonged debt repayment period. The formula for calculation is provided below, with Restore plc.'s net debt to EBITDA ratios illustrated in the graph.

**Figure 46.26: Restore plc. Net Debt to EBITDA Ratios from 2004 to 2023**

Although Restore plc.'s net debt to EBITDA ratio exhibits a generally stable trend over the years, it is noted that the ratio turned negative during the crisis of 2008.

**Financial Structure and Debt Ratios:** This metric, indicating an entity's financial structure, reveals long-term debt-paying capacity and debt ratios from a financial management perspective, proving critical for investors and creditors. The reliance on borrowing increases risk while diminishing creditor security or vice versa. 

**Solvency Ratio (Asset Based):** The asset-based solvency ratio denotes the proportion of a company's assets covering its debts. Solvency, which measures the ability to pay long-term debt and its interest, holds substantial importance as a financial risk analysis indicator, aiding business owners, investors, and creditors in assessing the company's long-term survival prospects. This ratio clarifies whether the company is financed by equity, debt, or a combination of both through financial analysis. Its formula is shown below.

The graph below demonstrates the asset-based solvency ratios for Restore plc.

**Figure 47.27: Restore plc. Asset-Based Solvency Ratios from 2004 to 2023**

The graph illustrates that during the global crisis from 2004 to 2009, Restore plc. reduced this ratio to as low as 9.32% and resorted to excessive borrowing; subsequent years, however, depict a gradual decrease in borrowing, managing the ratio within the 40% to 50% range.

**Solvency Ratio (Liability Based):** This ratio measures the ratio of a company's total liabilities to its current assets, alongside indicating the extent of leverage used. It reveals how much of the business is financed by debt versus assets. Furthermore, this ratio indicates the ability to fulfill obligations with current assets. A ratio particularly below 1.0 indicates significant debt financing and potential difficulties in meeting obligations. The formula for calculation is provided below. The liability-based solvency ratios for Restore are depicted in the graph.

Figure 48.28: Liability-Based Solvency Ratio of Restore plc, 2004-2023.

Throughout its history, the liability-based solvency ratio of Restore plc has exhibited a stable trend, although significant borrowing was observed following the 2008 crisis.

Assets to Equity Ratio: Derived from the information in a company’s balance sheet, this ratio expresses the ability of a company to pay all its debts if it were suddenly forced to liquidate. The assets to equity ratio particularly measures the amount of equity the company has when compared to its total assets. A high ratio may indicate that the company operates with a dependence on debt or financial leverage. The calculation formula is as follows.

The chart illustrates the assets to equity ratios of Restore plc.

Figure 49.29: Restore plc Assets to Equity Ratios, 2004-2023.

According to these data, it can be said that the assets to equity ratio of Restore plc exhibits parallelism with the liability-based solvency ratio over the years, reaching its all-time peak during the crisis period.

Long Term Debt to Total Equity: The debt ratio of a business is a criterion for managerial stability. A high debt ratio indicates that the company is financially endangered. However, well-managed debt is also considered an important way for businesses to invest or enhance their capacities. Therefore, it is important to evaluate this together with other metrics. The calculation formula is as follows.

The chart presents the long-term debt to total equity ratios of Restore plc.

Figure 50.30: Long Term Debt to Total Equity Ratios of Restore plc, 2004-2023.

As shown in the chart, the company has managed its long-term liabilities in a balanced manner against its total equity, except during the 2008 crisis period. Particularly, it is known to have utilized long-term debt as leverage for acquisitions discussed in previous sections.

Gearing: This ratio involves comparing the amount of borrowed capital of a business as a way to measure its financial health. It is also an indicator of how “leveraged” the company is—in other words, the extent to which debt finances a company's operations. A high gearing ratio indicates a high level of debt compared to equity. Depending on the industry, this could or could not be an indicator of financial risk. The formula for calculating the gearing ratio appears below. The chart provides the gearing ratios of the company.

Figure 51.31: Gearing Ratios of Restore plc, 2004-2023.

As can be understood from the chart, Restore plc is a highly leveraged company. This could be due to sectoral tendencies, or it may reflect a strategic approach linked to the company’s operational acquisitions. Examining the gearing ratio metric in conjunction with sectoral data and the company's leverage strategy will allow for a more accurate assessment.

4.2.4. Employee Yield Ratios

This denotes the revenue per employee, calculated by dividing total revenue by the current number of employees. It is an important metric that measures how much money each employee generates for the business. Additionally, it shows how efficiently management utilizes its human resources. These ratios can be examined under two subheadings: financial performance indicators and cost and operational efficiency indicators.

Financial Performance Indicators: Employee financial performance metrics measure how much profit a business generates per employee, the contribution of employees to operational revenue, and the efficiency of equity per employee. Here, the subcategories of profit per employee, operational revenue per employee, and equity per employee can be examined.

Profit per Employee: Profit per employee is one of the most important ways for a business to generate returns from intangible digital assets without increasing its capital intensity. The calculation formula is provided below.

The chart shows the profit per employee figures of Restore plc over the years.

Figure 52.32: Profit per Employee Figures for Restore plc, 2004-2023.

From its inception until the 2008 crisis, Restore plc profited from its employees. However, despite redundancies during the crisis, it incurred losses as figures exceeded 17,000 pounds. Following the ecosystem creation process after 2010, this situation changed positively, and profits per employee nearly reached 13,000 pounds. Yet, as observed in some other charts, 2023 saw significantly notable negative changes.

### Operating Revenue per Employee

Operating revenue per employee is a metric that indicates how much revenue a company generates from its operations for each employee. The calculation formula is as follows:

The graph illustrates the operating revenue per employee for Restore plc. over the years.

**Figure 53.33: Operating Revenue per Employee for Restore plc., 2004-2023**

From the graph above, it can be observed that the employees of Restore plc. consistently contribute to the company's operational activities in a stable manner relative to net incomes. These data also demonstrate that the management effectively utilizes the Group’s human resources.

### Equity per Employee

Equity per employee is a metric that shows how much each employee contributes to the company’s equity. It is a method frequently preferred by analysts to understand how much employees contribute to competition compared to rival companies in the industry, and whether the company is using its capital effectively relative to its employees. The following formula is applied to calculate equity per employee:

The number of employees and their contributions to equity over the years for Restore plc. are as follows.

**Figure 54.34: Equity per Employee for Restore plc., 2004-2023**

Although there was a deviation in equity per employee during the establishment period due to the low number of employees for Restore plc., a balanced management approach was exhibited over the years. However, during the 2008 crisis, losses in equity impacted this metric negatively.

### Cost and Operating Efficiency Indicators

Cost efficiency indicators measure how much a business spends in its production or service processes and how these costs relate to its revenues. Operating efficiency indicators cover how efficiently a business obtains income and profits from its main activities using the resources at its disposal. These can be examined in terms of average cost per employee, working capital per employee, total assets per employee, and the ratio of costs per employee to operating revenues.

### Average Cost of Employee

Average cost of employee is a metric derived by dividing the total costs incurred for employees by the number of employees. Businesses and analysts use this data for efficiency and cost control. High and low average costs have their own intrinsic advantages and disadvantages. For example, a high average cost might lead researchers to conclude that the business cannot control its personnel expenses, whereas a low average cost might imply low efficiency. The formula for calculating the average cost per employee is provided below.

Below is the average personnel cost by year for the company.

**Figure 55.35: Average Cost per Employee for Restore plc., 2004-2023**

The graph indicates that the average cost of an employee to Restore plc. fluctuated over the years. While crises can cause this variability, it is also thought that new personnel from acquired firms, based on purchasing strategies, may have an impact.

### Working Capital per Employee

Working capital per employee is a financial metric that measures the amount of working capital currently available, calculated by dividing the total working capital by the number of employees. It is used to evaluate operational efficiency and measure capital intensity per employee. The formula for this calculation is as follows:

**Figure 56.36: Working Capital per Employee for Restore plc., 2004-2023**

The graph shows a variable distribution and intensity of working capital per employee for Restore plc. over the years. When evaluating this data, factors such as fluctuations in employment numbers and acquisitions of new firms should also be considered.

### Total Assets per Employee

Total assets per employee is a financial measure that calculates the average value of total assets allocated to each employee, determined by dividing the company's total assets by the number of employees.

**Figure 57.37: Total Assets per Employee for Restore plc., 2004-2023**

Excluding the standard deviation caused by having only two registered employees in the founding year, certain ratios of total assets per employee have been achieved over the years.

### Restore plc. FTSE AIM Index Performance

Restore plc. was listed on the LSE AIM stock exchange under the code RSTP on November 5, 2004, and its shares are traded in the liquid market in real time. The graph presents the monthly performance of the shares traded from the date of listing up to the present.

Figure 58.38: Performance of Restore plc. on the FTSE AIM Stock Exchange from 2005 to 2023

As evident in the graph, the RSTE stock, which demonstrated an upward trend prior to the 2008 crisis, experienced a downturn during the crisis, with an increased frequency range of the differential on a monthly basis. In an effort to maintain the stock's reputation and alter negative perceptions, the group underwent a reverse stock split on July 27, 2010, at a ratio of 1:2. A reverse stock split is a corporate action whereby the number of shares in circulation is reduced, proportionally increasing the stock price. This practice, generally aimed at meeting listing requirements or improving the perceived value of the stock, is an action compliant with stock market regulations. Subsequently, the firm's stock entered an upward trend, maintaining stability until the downturn between January and March 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this financial crisis greatly affecting global trade due to measures like lockdowns compared to the previous crisis, it is evident from the graph that Restore plc. conducted more effective crisis management.

CONCLUSION

The information and document management sector is being reshaped by the profound changes brought about by digital transformation. This process is not limited to the modernization of operational workflows but has also led to the redefinition of customer relationships, business models, and industrial competition. Restore plc., which provides information and document management services, has adopted an ecosystem approach that combines both physical and digital services, standing out as a pioneer in this transformation. It is evaluated that firms focusing on digital services or specific technologies can also play a critical role and define the direction of competition.

The ecosystem created by Restore plc. aims to offer integrated solutions addressing customer needs. By combining different business areas such as document management, data destruction, IT asset management, and office relocation, the firm provides end-to-end solutions to its clients. This strategy has directly contributed positively to the firm's financial performance, ensuring long-term revenue models and high retention rates, thus granting a competitive advantage in the industry. Furthermore, ESG strategies and sustainability-focused services have enabled Restore plc. not only to achieve financial success but also to fulfill its social and environmental responsibilities. However, this approach is not confined solely to the success of the Group. Other pioneering firms focusing on digital transformation have also catalyzed change in the industry with similar strategies.

In this research, it has been observed that by leveraging the opportunities offered by digital transformation, Restore plc. has succeeded in overcoming the limitations imposed by traditional methods in information and document management. While traditional methods provided only physical storage and limited access, digital solutions have made it possible to access information anytime and anywhere. In this context, the firm has utilized innovative technologies such as cloud-based storage systems, electronic archiving solutions, and robotic process automation. These technologies have increased the efficiency of operational processes and strengthened customer satisfaction. By integrating these digital solutions with ESG compliance, the firm has successfully delivered more transparent, reliable, and sustainable services to its clients. However, it has been noted that the new services emerging from these technological advancements present challenges and uncertainties alongside opportunities. In this thesis, while uncovering and evaluating the outcomes of Restore plc.’s industrial success, critical elements that may arise in the long term have also been explored. These elements are identified and suggested, including laws, technological infrastructure, sectoral competition, and the future of information and document management. Therefore, to understand the impact of new technologies on the discipline of information and document management, it is believed that the following questions need to be addressed.

Legal Regulations: How can compliance with personal data protection laws (such as GDPR, CCPA) in different countries be ensured for AI-supported document management systems? What types of standardization work should be conducted for these systems to operate compatibly with legal regulations in the context of international trade and data transfer? Is it possible to establish a global framework for the ethical use of AI technologies? How should this framework address regional and sectoral differences? For instance, how can the obligation to ensure transparency in decision-making processes by AI algorithms be applied across different sectors? What types of support mechanisms are needed for small and medium enterprises to overcome the hurdles posed by high costs and complex legal regulations for AI compliance? What solutions can public-private partnerships offer in this context?

Technological Advancement and Compatibility: When AI-based process automation, document classification, and data analytics become fully dominant, under what conditions will these technologies require human intervention? How can the ideal balance of human and AI collaboration in information management be achieved? How effective can methods like "adversary tests" be in AI systems to ensure data accuracy and reliability? What standards should regulate algorithm transparency and oversight to prevent biases in AI operation? How can cybersecurity vulnerabilities that replace traditional methods with AI-based systems be prevented in the field of document management? What security measures should be taken to enhance the industry's resilience, particularly against threats like ransomware attacks?

Market Share and Competition: How do AI technologies contribute to the market share growth of major players while creating pressure on smaller firms? What innovative financing models can be applied to provide cost-effective access to AI solutions for these firms to remain competitive? If discrepancies in technological access lead to innovations being adopted solely by larger companies, how does this affect industry-wide innovation? What should regulators and industry organizations do to prevent monopolistic tendencies? How can AI-based technologies transform the current market structure with the entry of technology giants from outside the sector into the information and document management industry? How does this compel traditional firms to alter their business models?

Customer Orientation and Trust: What methodologies can be employed to enhance the transparency of AI-supported document management systems? For instance, can the explainability of AI decisions increase customer trust? How should companies redesign their internal policies and audit processes to prevent ethical violations in AI usage? Can third-party audit mechanisms offer an effective solution for ensuring data security and privacy? How important is it to make AI user-friendly to alleviate customer concerns? For example, can a "human-approval" mechanism be designed to enable clients to intervene in document management systems?

Sustainability and ESG Compliance: While it is possible for AI to optimize energy consumption in information and document management, how can the risk of increased carbon footprints from these technologies be balanced? What incentive mechanisms can be applied to transition to carbon-neutral AI systems in the industry? What innovative approaches can be adopted to reduce the environmental impact of AI following ESG strategies? For instance, how should the development of lower energy-consuming versions of AI systems be prioritized? How do the advantages AI provides in achieving sustainability targets affect economic inequalities in the information and document management industry? While large firms rapidly adopt these advantages, what challenges might smaller firms face in transitioning to ESG compliance?

Standards and Certifications: International Alignment and Competition: How can international standards like ISO 15489 (Information and Document Management) and ISO 27001 (Information Security Management System) be integrated into AI-supported information and document management systems? How does the adoption of these standards affect firms' competitiveness in international markets? What challenges arise from achieving global standard compliance due to local regulations and cultural differences? With the rapid advancement of technology, are ISO and similar standards being updated quickly enough? Is it possible for standards to evolve into a more dynamic structure to keep pace with current technological developments? How can cooperation between the industry and standard-setting organizations be developed in this context?

Education and Awareness: How should the educational needs of professionals in the industry be met to effectively implement standards? What role can universities and educational institutions play regarding standards and certification? How can academic studies contribute to the development and improvement of standards?

These questions are of critical importance not only within the industrial context but also within a broader technological and social framework. The effects of AI and digital transformation on information and document management bring uncertainties as much as opportunities. Will academic institutions, researchers, and strong companies like Restore plc. actively seek answers to these questions in collaboration with other stakeholders in the industry, despite being pioneers of this transformation? Because it is believed that in the era of digital transformation and AI, sectoral sustainability depends not only on technological innovations but also on the scientific, social, and legal aspects of these innovations.
